# Self-deprecating humor — 2025-10-03

Hey, fellow teens! Let’s talk about self-deprecating humor – you know, when we make jokes at our own expense. It's all fun and games until it leaves us feeling down. Yeah, we all love a good chuckle, but constant self-roasting can take a toll on our self-esteem. It’s like trying to put out a fire with gasoline - not a great idea.

Sure, a little self-deprecating humor can be hilarious, but we gotta remember to show ourselves some love too. It’s cool to laugh at ourselves sometimes, but we shouldn’t make it a habit. We’re awesome just the way we are, flaws and all! So next time you catch yourself going overboard with the self-bashing jokes, take a step back and remember: you’re worth more than the punchline.

Stay witty, stay sharp, stay fabulous! Remember, you're the star of your own show, so don’t let self-deprecation steal the spotlight. Peace out! ✌️ #SelfLove #BeYourOwnCheerleader
