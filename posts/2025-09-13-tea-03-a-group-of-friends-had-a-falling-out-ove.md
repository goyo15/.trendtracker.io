# A group of friends had a falling-out over a social media post gone wrong. — 2025-09-13

Hey, fam! It's your girl, Sarah, back with some serious tea to spill. 💁🏻‍♀️ So, here's the scoop – a tight-knit squad I know recently had a major meltdown over a social media post that totally backfired. Like, we're talking friendships shattered into a million pieces kinda drama. 👀

It all started with a seemingly innocent post that spiraled out of control faster than you can say “Insta-worthy.” Suddenly, shady comments were flying, screenshots were being shared like wildfire, and before we knew it, this squad was more like a battlefield. 🙅🏻‍♀️

Lesson learned, peeps: think twice before hitting that “post” button. Words can cut deeper than you think, and once it's out there, you can't take it back. Friendship is precious, so let's spread positivity and love instead of drama and hate. Keep it classy, not trashy. Stay tuned for more hot goss next time! 🔥 #sippingthetea #dramallama
