# Food and snack preferences — 2026-02-20

Hey fam! Let’s talk food and snack preferences, shall we? As a teen constantly on the go, having the perfect snacks on hand is a total game-changer. For me, it’s all about that perfect mix of sweet and savory. I’m talking about chips and salsa, popcorn with M&M’s (don’t knock it ‘til you try it), and of course, the ultimate guilty pleasure: cheesy fries. 

On the flip side, healthy snacks are also key to keeping me fueled and focused. Think crunchy veggies with hummus, Greek yogurt with honey and granola, and fresh fruit smoothies. Balancing the indulgent with the nutritious is my go-to move. 

So, what are your fave snacks that get you through those long study sessions or epic Netflix binges? Drop your snack recommendations in the comments below, and let’s keep the snack game strong! ✌️🍿🥕 #snackattack
