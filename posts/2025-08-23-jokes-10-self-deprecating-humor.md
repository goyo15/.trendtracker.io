# Self-Deprecating Humor — 2025-08-23

Hey there, fellow teens! Let’s talk about self-deprecating humor – you know, that trend of roasting yourself for laughs. At first glance, it might seem like the ultimate form of coolness, showing you don’t take yourself too seriously. But hold up - is it all fun and games or feeding into negative self-talk? 

Sure, a good self-deprecating joke can earn you some laughs and make you seem relatable. But constantly putting yourself down can chip away at your self-esteem faster than you can say “just kidding”. It’s like giving yourself a permission slip to be your own bully. Remember, you’re way too awesome to be the butt of your own jokes all the time.

So, let’s keep it real - a little self-mocking is fine, but let’s not turn self-deprecation into self-destruction. Let’s aim for humor that lifts us up, not tears us down. Because, hey, we’ve got enough haters out there, we don’t need to join in on the self-hate party. Peace out, self-lovers! 💁‍♀️✌️🔥 #SelfLove #NoSelfRoastAllowed
