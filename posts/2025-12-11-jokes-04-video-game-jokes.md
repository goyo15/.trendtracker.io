# Video game jokes — 2025-12-11

Hey fam, let’s talk about video game jokes because they never get old, am I right? Whether it’s a classic Mario pun or a witty reference to a boss battle, they always hit the right button for a good laugh. Like, who else can relate to trying to pause life when things get too real? And don’t even get me started on the struggles of finding a save point in real life – it’s a whole mood. 

And let’s not forget those iconic game glitches that make you question reality. Like, sorry bro, I didn’t know gravity is a suggestion in this game. And when NPCs walk into walls like they’ve got a secret mission to break the simulation – it’s gold! 

So, next time you’re feeling a little low on HP, just remember, video game jokes are the perfect power-up to level up your mood. Keep slaying, gamers! 🔥🎮 #LevelUpLaughs
