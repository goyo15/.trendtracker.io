# Gen Z slang and expressions — 2025-10-27

Hey squad, let’s talk Gen Z slang and expressions! 🌟 This generation has its own lingo that keeps evolving faster than you can say “lit”. From “stan” to “tea” to “sksksk”, we’re basically speaking our own language at this point. So, if you’re still saying “on fleek” or “YOLO”, it’s time to update your vocab game, my dudes. Need a quick guide to understanding Gen Z speak? Just hop on TikTok for a crash course in “vibing”, “simping”, and “clout”. Trust me, you’ll be “woke” in no time. And remember, it’s all about using these words ironically, unironically, and everything in between. Stay woke, stay extra, and most importantly, stay true to your own unique voice. Keep slaying those everyday moments, fam. Catch you on the flip side! 💁‍♀️🔥✨ #GenZ #SlayTheSlang #StayWoke
