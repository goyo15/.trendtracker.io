Hey, fam! Let’s talk about something super important today - anti-racism resources and education 🌟. It’s 2021, and we all know that racism is NOT cool. So, let’s educate ourselves and take action to create a more inclusive world. Whether it’s reading books like “How to Be an Antiracist” by Ibram X. Kendi or watching documentaries like “13th”, there are so many ways to learn and grow. Check out podcasts, follow activists on social media, and engage in conversations with friends and family about race and privilege. Together, we can make a difference and stand up against racism in all its forms. Remember, being anti-racist isn’t a trend - it’s a lifelong commitment to justice and equality.
