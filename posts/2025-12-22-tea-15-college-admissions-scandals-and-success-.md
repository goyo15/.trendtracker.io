# College admissions scandals and success stories — 2025-12-22

Hey fam, let's spill the tea ☕ on these college admissions scandals and the inspiring success stories that make us believe in our own hustle. From rich parents bribing their way into top schools to students pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, the college admissions game is like a twisted mix of Gossip Girl and Glee.

Sure, the scandals make our eyes roll so hard they almost get stuck, but let’s not forget the real MVPs – the students who grind hard, volunteer, work multiple jobs, and still manage to slay their way into their dream schools. Their success stories remind us that hard work and determination pay off in the end, no matter how many Felicity Huffmans try to cheat the system.

So take a note from these legends and keep slaying, whether you’re aiming for Ivy League glory or community college charm. Your hustle will always speak louder than any scandalous scheme. Stay real, stay fierce, stay on that grind. 💪 #CollegeThrive #NoScandalsNeeded
