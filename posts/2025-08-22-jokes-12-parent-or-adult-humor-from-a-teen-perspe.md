# Parent or adult humor from a teen perspective — 2025-08-22

Alright, let’s talk about parent or adult humor – from a teen’s point of view. 🙄 Listen, we get it, our parents think they’re hilarious with their dad jokes and mom puns. But let me tell you, there’s a fine line between funny and cringe-worthy. Like, please spare us from the corny jokes during family dinners, we just wanna eat our food in peace, not listen to another round of “knock-knock” jokes. And don’t even get me started on celebrity impressions or outdated references – we’re not living in the 80s, Mom! 😂 But hey, every now and then, they do manage to crack a joke that actually gets a chuckle out of us. So parents, keep trying, even if we roll our eyes, deep down we appreciate the effort. Just remember, less is more when it comes to adult humor around teens. Keep it short, sweet, and maybe just a tad less cheesy. 😉 #TeenPerspective #EyeRollsOnFleek
