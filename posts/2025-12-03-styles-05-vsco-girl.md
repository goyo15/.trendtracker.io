# VSCO girl — 2025-12-03

Hey fellow teens, let’s talk about the infamous VSCO girl trend that’s been taking over our feeds lately. From scrunchies and hydro flasks to oversized t-shirts and Birkenstocks, these girls are all about that laid-back, beachy vibe. But let’s be real, being a VSCO girl is more than just a fashion statement – it’s a lifestyle.

With their love for the environment and obsession with saving the turtles, VSCO girls are all about spreading positive vibes and promoting sustainability. Sure, they might get some eye-rolls for constantly saying “and I oop” or rocking a messy bun, but you gotta give them props for being unapologetically themselves.

So whether you’re already embracing the VSCO girl aesthetic or just casually observing from the sidelines, remember to stay true to who you are and never be afraid to rock that shell necklace or reusable metal straw. After all, being a VSCO girl is all about doing your part to save the planet while having fun along the way.✌️🌊🐢 #Sksksk #SaveTheTurtles
