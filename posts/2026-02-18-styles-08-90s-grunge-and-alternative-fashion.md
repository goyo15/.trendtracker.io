# 90s grunge and alternative fashion — 2026-02-18

Hey there, fellow fashionistas! Let’s talk about 90s grunge and alternative fashion! Can we all agree that the 90s had some seriously cool style vibes going on? From ripped jeans and flannel shirts to chunky platform shoes, this era knew how to rock the edgy and rebellious look like nobody’s business. 

I’m totally obsessed with how bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam influenced fashion back then – think oversized band tees, combat boots, and dark lipstick. And let’s not forget about the iconic slip dresses and chokers that were all the rage! 

What I love most about 90s grunge and alternative fashion is how effortlessly cool and unique it all is. It’s all about mixing and matching different pieces to create your own one-of-a-kind style. So, whether you’re channeling your inner Courtney Love or exploring your own twist on this rad era, just remember to rock it with confidence and attitude! Peace out ✌️ #grungeforever #alternativefashionista
