# E-Girl/E-Boy Aesthetic â€” 2025-07-13

Hey babes and baddies! Let's talk about the E-Girl/E-Boy aesthetic that's been taking over our screens and feeds lately. From neon hair to heavy eyeliner, this trend is all about embracing your edgy side and not giving a single care in the world.

For the E-Girls, it's all about that pastel goth vibe with a touch of '90s nostalgia. Think oversized graphic tees, plaid skirts, and black platform boots. And don't forget the iconic heart-shaped makeup under the eyes!

On the flip side, E-Boys are all about that skater-meets-streetwear look. Baggy pants, chain necklaces, and messy hair are the staples of this aesthetic. Add in some face tattoos and you're ready to hit the streets looking effortlessly cool.

Whether you're an E-Girl, E-Boy, or somewhere in between, remember to rock your own unique style with confidence. Embrace the boldness, break the rules, and slay the game, my loves! #Egirl #Eboy #AestheticGoals ðŸ’œðŸ’€âœ¨
