Hey, fellow trendsetters! Let’s talk about the VSCO girl aesthetic that’s been taking social media by storm. Picture this: oversized t-shirts, scrunchies for days, and Birkenstock sandals – that’s basically the VSCO girl starter pack. This laid-back, beachy style is all about embracing a chill, carefree vibe while staying effortlessly cool.

From sipping on reusable metal straws to sporting colorful friendship bracelets, VSCO girls are all about eco-conscious and sustainable living. They’re the queens of natural, minimal makeup and embracing their fresh-faced glow. Who needs heavy foundation when you’ve got the sun-kissed look down pat?

So, grab your Hydro Flask, slip on those Birks, and don’t forget to apply a layer of lip balm – because being a VSCO girl is all about embracing your inner beach babe with a touch of trendy flair. Stay relaxed, stay stylish, and keep rocking the VSCO girl vibes!✌️🌊🌸 #VSCOgirl #BeachyChic #Trendsetter
