# Social media observations and jokes — 2025-12-15

Hey fellow teens! Let’s talk about the weird and wild world of social media. Ever notice how people post about their workout routines but are never actually at the gym? And don’t get me started on those “just woke up like this” selfies with obviously filtered faces. 

Also, why do some people feel the need to share every detail of their day? Like, we don’t need a play-by-play of your trip to the grocery store, Karen. And let’s not forget the dreaded Facebook mom jokes that make us cringe harder than a bad TikTok dance.

But hey, let’s give credit where it’s due – social media can be a hilarious place too. From savage clapbacks to viral memes, it’s where the real entertainment happens. So, keep scrolling, keep laughing, and maybe take a break from posting about your avocado toast. Stay snarky, my friends! #SocialMediaSass
