Hey fam, let's talk about music and band jokes that are straight-up hilarious! Whether you're a band geek or just appreciate a good pun, these jokes will have you laughing out loud faster than you can say "tuning up your instrument."

Why did the musician get kicked out of the band? Because he was always flat!

What do you call a cow that plays the guitar? A moo-sician!

Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing. Wait, that's not a music joke, but it's still pretty funny, right?

These jokes may be cheesy, but they're sure to strike a chord with any music lover. So next time you're jamming out with your friends, drop one of these jokes and watch them bust a gut. Keep the music alive, and keep the jokes coming, because laughter is always the best medicine (besides good music, of course!). Stay punny, my friends! Peace out ✌️🎵
