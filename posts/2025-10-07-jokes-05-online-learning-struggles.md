# Online learning struggles — 2025-10-07

Hey fam, let’s talk about the struggles of online learning 🤦‍♀️ Can we just agree that Zoom fatigue is REAL? Staring at a screen all day trying to absorb info is like trying to learn algebra from a TikTok tutorial – not gonna happen. And don’t get me started on the WiFi woes 📶 One minute you’re in the middle of a bomb lecture, next minute you’re frozen like a screenshot. Ugh, the struggle is real! Plus, staying motivated without your squad around to hype you up is tough. It’s like trying to vibe to your fave playlist with a dead battery – not the same energy. So, let’s power through, stay connected, and remember that this virtual grind won’t last forever. Hang in there, fam! 💻📚 #OnlineLearningStruggles #ZoomLife
