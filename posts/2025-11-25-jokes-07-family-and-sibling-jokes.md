# Family and sibling jokes — 2025-11-25

Hey fam! Let’s talk about family and sibling jokes – they’re like the secret language of our squad, am I right? Whether it’s roasting each other at the dinner table or sending memes in the group chat, sibling banter is EVERYTHING. My bro thinks he’s hilarious with his dad jokes, but I’m always quick with a comeback. And don’t even get me started on the inside jokes we have with our cousins – it’s like our own private comedy show. Sure, sometimes things can get a little too savage and someone ends up in tears (usually my little sis), but at the end of the day, it’s all love and laughter. So next time your fam is teasing you, just remember it’s all in good fun. Embrace the chaos, embrace the jokes, and keep that family bond strong. #SiblingSquadGoals 🤣👯‍♂️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
