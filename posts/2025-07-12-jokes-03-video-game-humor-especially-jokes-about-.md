# Video game humor (especially jokes about popular games like Fortnite or Among Us) — 2025-07-12

Hey, fellow gamers! Let’s talk about video game humor – because nothing beats a good laugh while kicking butt in Fortnite or trying to suss out the Impostor in Among Us. 🎮😂

You know those moments when you’re playing and something hilarious goes down? Like when you accidentally shoot your own teammate in Fortnite and they give you that look like, “Really, dude?” Or when everyone is accusing each other of being the Impostor in Among Us and it’s just chaotic AF.

And don’t even get me started on the memes and jokes that come out of these games. From “emergency meeting” memes to the classic “default dance” in Fortnite, the gaming community sure knows how to turn a simple moment into pure comedy gold.

So next time you’re gaming, keep an eye out for those funny moments – because sometimes the best part of playing is sharing a laugh with your fellow gamers. Stay witty, stay gaming! ✌️🎮 #GameHumorGang #LMAO
