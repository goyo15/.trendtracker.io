# VSCO Girl - Although the trend has slightly waned, the VSCO girl style, with its emphasis on scrunchies, Hydro Flasks, and laid-back beachy vibes, still holds some influence. — 2026-01-17

Hey there, fellow trendsetters! Let’s talk VSCO girls. 🌺🤙 Yeah, yeah, I know the trend might be cooling off a bit, but let’s be real – the VSCO girl aesthetic still has major clout. Scrunchies? Um, yes please. Hydro Flasks? Keep 'em coming. And those laid-back beachy vibes? I'm all about it, dude. 💁‍♀️🏄‍♀️

Sure, some may call it basic, but let’s not hate on what makes us feel good and confident, am I right? Besides, who wouldn't want to channel those carefree, ocean-loving vibes on the daily?

So, to all the VSCO girls out there, keep rocking your oversized t-shirts, save the turtles, and always remember – you do you, girl. And hey, if anyone gives you flack for it, just toss them a peace sign and sip some iced coffee in your scrunchie. Stay trendy, stay true. Catch ya on the flip side! 🦋✌️ #VSCOgirl4life
