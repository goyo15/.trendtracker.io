# Parental misunderstandings of technology — 2025-12-09

Hey fam, let's talk about the struggles of dealing with parents who just don't GET technology. I mean, seriously, it's like we're speaking a whole different language when we try to explain things to them.

You know the drill – they can't figure out how to send a simple text, they're always asking for help with setting up the WiFi, and don't even get me started on trying to explain social media algorithms to them.

But hey, I get it. They didn't grow up with smartphones glued to their hands like we did. Still, it's super frustrating when they constantly mix up emojis or think every online friend is a potential scammer.

We love our parents, but sometimes we just wanna shout, "It's not that hard, just google it!" So here's to all the teens out there dealing with parental tech misunderstandings – stay patient, stay tech-savvy, and maybe one day we'll get through to them. ✌️ #ParentalTechFail #TeenStruggles
