# A senior prank gone wrong resulted in disciplinary action for the students involved. â€” 2025-09-13

Hey fam, let's talk about that senior prank that totally backfired on some students, resulting in major disciplinary action. Look, I get it, senior year is all about going out with a bang, but sometimes you gotta draw the line. Sure, harmless pranks can be funny, but crossing boundaries just isn't cool.

I mean, we all want to leave our mark on the school before we peace out, but there are better ways to do it than getting on the wrong side of the admin. Plus, getting in trouble right before graduation? Not a good look, my friends.

So, let's remember that while senior year is all about making memories, we gotta be smart about it. Let's keep the pranks light, the vibes positive, and avoid the drama. We're almost outta here, let's finish strong, not in detention. Stay savvy, my fellow seniors. Peace out! #SeniorPrankGoneWrong #LearnFromMistakes
