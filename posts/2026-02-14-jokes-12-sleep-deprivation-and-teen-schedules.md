# Sleep Deprivation and Teen Schedules — 2026-02-14

Hey fam, let's talk about the ultimate struggle we all know too well - sleep deprivation and our chaotic teen schedules. We’re out here juggling school, extracurriculars, social lives, and self-care (kinda), but who’s got time for a full eight hours of sleep, amirite?

We’re running on caffeine, sheer willpower, and maybe a little regret from starting that Netflix binge at 2am. But real talk - lack of sleep can seriously mess with our mental and physical health. It’s like trying to function on a glitchy phone - eventually, it crashes.

So, let’s make a pact to prioritize our zzz’s. Set boundaries, ditch the late-night scrolling, and snuggle up with a good book instead. Our future selves will thank us. And remember, it’s okay to say no to some things and put yourself first. Let’s reclaim our sleep, one cozy blanket and pillow at a time. 🌙💤 #SleepRevolution #TeenLife
