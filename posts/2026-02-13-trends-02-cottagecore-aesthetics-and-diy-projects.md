# Cottagecore aesthetics and DIY projects — 2026-02-13

Hey there, fellow teen DIY-ers and cottagecore enthusiasts! Let's talk about how to bring those cozy, countryside vibes into our bedrooms with some adorable projects. 🌿🏡

First up, we've got homemade pressed flower bookmarks – the perfect way to add a touch of whimsy to our reading nooks. All you need is some flowers, wax paper, and a heavy book to press them in, and voila! Instant cottagecore charm for our favorite novels.

Next, let's spruce up our walls with DIY woven tapestries using natural fibers like jute and cotton. Not only will they add texture and warmth to our rooms, but they'll also give us major cottagecore street cred.

Whether it's crafting floral wreaths, making scented candles, or embroidering throw pillows with nature-inspired designs, there are endless ways to bring the cottagecore aesthetic into our lives. So let's get creative and make our spaces a cozy haven straight out of a fairytale! 🌻✨ #CottagecoreDIYs #TeenCreativity
