# Slang and Catchphrases — 2025-09-14

Hey fam, let’s talk about slang and catchphrases—because let’s be real, they're like the seasoning that adds flavor to our conversations, am I right? From “lit” to “savage” to “sksksk,” every generation invents new words and phrases that become instant classics. It’s like our secret language that sets us apart from the adults. 

But here’s the tea: slang can be tricky. Some words are so 2020 while others have that timeless vibe that never goes out of style. And let’s not forget the power of a good catchphrase—like “yas queen” or “no cap”—that can sum up a whole mood in just a few words.

So, whether you’re keeping up with the latest trends or throwing it back to the OG slang, just remember to keep it authentic and true to you. Let your words be a reflection of your personality and vibe, because at the end of the day, that’s what makes you stand out from the crowd. Stay slaying, my peeps! 🙌✨
