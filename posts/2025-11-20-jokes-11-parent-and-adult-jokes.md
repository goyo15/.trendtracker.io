# Parent and adult jokes — 2025-11-20

Hey there, fellow teens! Let’s talk about the cringeworthy topic of parent and adult jokes. You know the ones - the eye-roll-inducing puns or cheesy one-liners that leave us wishing we were anywhere but within earshot. Don’t get me wrong, parents mean well, but sometimes their attempts at humor can be major facepalm moments. 

From dad jokes to mom jokes, it seems like they have a never-ending arsenal of corny punchlines ready to unleash at any moment. And let’s not forget those awkward adult jokes that fly over our heads or make us blush in embarrassment. While we may not always appreciate their sense of humor, we’ve got to give them credit for trying (emphasis on trying). 

So next time your parent drops a cringy joke, just remember to groan loudly, roll your eyes dramatically, and maybe even throw in a fake laugh for good measure. After all, it’s all part of the parent-teen dynamic, right? Stay strong out there, friends, and may the cringe be ever in your favor! #ParentJokes #CringeCity
