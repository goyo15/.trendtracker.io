# VSCO girl style: Casual and laid-back with a focus on sustainability and eco-friendly fashion choices. — 2025-07-28

Hey all you trendsetters out there! Let's talk about VSCO girl style - the ultimate blend of casual coolness and eco-conscious vibes. Say goodbye to over-the-top fashion and hello to laid-back, effortlessly chic looks that prioritize sustainability.

From oversized tees and scrunchies to Birkenstocks and metal straws, VSCO girls are all about embracing a carefree attitude while making environmentally-friendly choices. It’s all about rocking that scrunchie on your wrist, a hydro flask in hand, and a reusable tote bag slung over your shoulder.

So, let's take a cue from the VSCO girls and make a statement with our style choices while also being mindful of the planet. Remember, being fashionable doesn't have to mean sacrificing sustainability. Let's keep it chill, keep it cute, and keep it eco-friendly. #SaveTheTurtles, am I right? 🐢✌️ #VSCOgirlStyle
