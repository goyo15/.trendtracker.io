# School and homework jokes â€” 2025-07-09

What's the deal with schools giving us so much homework? It's like they think we don't have lives or Netflix shows to binge-watch. ðŸ™„ I mean, I get it, education is important and all that jazz, but can we chill with the never-ending assignments? 

And don't even get me started on those teachers who act like assigning more homework makes them the ruler of the universe. News flash, Ms. Smith, you're not Thanos. ðŸŒŒ 

But hey, at least we can laugh about the ridiculousness of it all. Like, why did the math book look sad? Because it had too many problems. ðŸ˜‚ Or how about that classic excuse of "My dog ate my homework"? Like, really? Who even falls for that anymore? 

In conclusion, school and homework may be a drag, but at least we can meme our way through it. Stay snarky, my fellow students. #HomeworkHumor #TeenBlogLife
