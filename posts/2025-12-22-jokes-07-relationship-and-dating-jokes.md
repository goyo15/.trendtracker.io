# Relationship and dating jokes — 2025-12-22

Hey there, my fellow jokesters! Let’s talk about relationship and dating jokes – the hilarious, the cringe-worthy, and everything in between. 🤣

We’ve all heard those cheesy pickup lines that make us roll our eyes so hard they almost get stuck in the back of our heads. But hey, sometimes they’re so bad, they’re good! Like, ‘Are you a bank loan? Because you got my interest.’ 😂

And don’t even get me started on the classic “So, do you come here often?” line. Seriously, does anyone actually use that in real life? If you do, please stop. 🙅‍♂️

But let’s give credit where credit is due – dating jokes can be a great way to break the ice and show off your sense of humor. Just don’t go too overboard unless you want your date to run in the opposite direction! 😉
