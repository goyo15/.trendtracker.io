# Drama involving the "Riverdale" cast members — 2026-01-23

Hey everyone, let’s dish about the latest juicy drama involving the “Riverdale” cast members! 🍿 Looks like the set of our favorite show is just as dramatic as the show itself lately.

First off, rumors are flying about some behind-the-scenes tension between Lili Reinhart and Cole Sprouse. Are they really on the rocks or is it just tabloid fodder? And don’t even get me started on the alleged drama between Camila Mendes and Charles Melton. Are they just friends or is there more going on off-screen?

And can we talk about Vanessa Morgan calling out the show for its lack of diversity? 👀 Props to her for speaking up and standing up for what she believes in. It’s about time Hollywood starts listening.

What do you think, Riverbabes? Is this real drama or just another publicity stunt? Let me know your thoughts in the comments! 🌟 #RiverdaleDrama #SpillTheTea
