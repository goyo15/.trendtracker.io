# Social media and selfies — 2025-11-24

Hey everyone! Let’s talk selfies and social media, shall we? 📸💁‍♀️

Listen, I’m all for showing off your best angles and capturing those moments that make you feel fab. But let’s not get too obsessed, okay? Our worth is not measured by the number of likes or comments we get on a selfie. Remember, filters and editing apps can make us look flawless, but real beauty shines from within. 

Also, let’s not forget that comparison is the thief of joy. Just be yourself, unapologetically. Embrace your unique quirks and imperfections - they’re what make you YOU.

So snap that selfie, post it if you want, but don’t let social media dictate your self-worth. Be kind to yourself, and others, both online and IRL. Stay fabulous, stay fierce, and keep slaying those selfies with confidence! ✨ #SelfieQueen #StayAuthentic
