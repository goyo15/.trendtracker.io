# Online Dating and Relationship Faux Pas — 2025-08-16

Hey there, fellow teens! Let’s spill the tea on online dating and relationship faux pas that are totally cringeworthy. Firstly, ghosting someone is a major no-no. Just be honest and upfront if you’re not feeling it instead of leaving them on read. Next up, catfishing - seriously, just be yourself, it’s not that hard! And please, don’t post misleading photos or lie about who you are. Moving on to the dreaded double texting – we all know it’s tempting, but give them time to respond before sending a follow-up message. Lastly, oversharing personal information or making things creepy by moving too fast is a recipe for disaster. Remember, it’s all about keeping it real and being respectful in the digital dating world. Stay savvy, stay cool, and don’t forget to swipe left on those relationship faux pas! Peace out ✌️.
