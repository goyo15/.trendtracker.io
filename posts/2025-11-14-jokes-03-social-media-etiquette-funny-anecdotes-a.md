# Social media etiquette - funny anecdotes about embarrassing posts, funny comments, and awkward DMs — 2025-11-14

Yo, let’s talk social media etiquette because we all know some of y’all need a serious refresher on what’s appropriate and what’s just plain cringe. 

Embarrassing posts? Oh, girl, where do I even start. Remember that time when I accidentally posted a screenshot of my crush’s profile instead of sending it to my bestie? Yeah, talk about mortifying. And don’t even get me started on the funny comments that end up being not so funny. Lesson learned: think twice before hitting send. 

Now, let’s talk about awkward DMs. Why do some people think it’s okay to slide into your messages with a cheesy pick-up line or a weird confession? No, thank you. Keep it classy, people. 

Take it from me, keep it real but keep it respectful when it comes to social media. Otherwise, you might end up on the next cringe compilation. Trust me, you don’t want that kind of fame. Peace out!
