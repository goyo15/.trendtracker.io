# VSCO girl aesthetic and lifestyle — 2026-02-11

Hey, VSCO girls are taking over the internet with their laidback aesthetic and eco-friendly vibes. From trendy scrunchies to reusable water bottles, these girls are all about saving the turtles and looking cute while doing it.

Rocking oversized shirts, Birkenstocks, and messy buns, the VSCO girl lifestyle is all about embracing a carefree attitude and being one with nature. They're the queens of hydro flasks and shell necklaces, always ready for a beach day or a photoshoot in the forest.

But it's not just about the accessories – it's a whole vibe. With their love for beaches, sunsets, and good vibes only, VSCO girls are spreading positivity and eco-consciousness wherever they go.

So grab your metal straws and your favorite Kanken backpack, because the VSCO girl aesthetic is here to stay. And remember, save the turtles, sis!🐢💕 #VSCOgirl #Sksksk
