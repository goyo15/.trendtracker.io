# Feuds between fanbases of different artists or influencers — 2025-09-14

Hey y’all, let’s talk about the drama that goes down when fanbases clash! We all know that loyalty runs deep when it comes to supporting our favorite artists or influencers, but some fans take it to the extreme. Whether it’s Taylor Swift stans vs. Katy Perry fanatics or James Charles enthusiasts vs. Jeffree Star supporters, these feuds can get seriously intense.

But here’s the thing: at the end of the day, it’s all about spreading positivity and supporting the people we love. There’s no need to tear others down or spread hate just because they prefer someone else. We all have different tastes and that’s what makes the world interesting!

So next time you see your timeline blowing up with arguments between fanbases, take a step back and remember that it’s okay to have different opinions. Let’s focus on lifting each other up and spreading love, because that’s what our faves would want us to do. Peace out ✌️ #NoMoreFeuds #SpreadLoveNotHate
