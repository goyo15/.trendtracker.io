# Preppy and collegiate looks — 2025-08-16

Hey fam, let's talk about preppy and collegiate looks - the ultimate vibe for fall! 🍂 Whether you're into plaid skirts, argyle sweaters, or varsity jackets, this style is all about looking sharp and put-together. Channel those Ivy League vibes with tailored blazers, crisp button-downs, and loafers to nail that classic yet cool look.

Mix and match pieces from your wardrobe to create your own spin on the preppy style. Swap out heels for sneakers, or add some streetwear flair with a baseball cap or oversized sunglasses. Don't be afraid to play around with different textures and patterns to keep things interesting.

So, grab your backpack, throw on a cable-knit sweater, and strut your stuff like you own the campus. Preppy and collegiate looks never go out of style, so let's embrace it and slay this season! 🔥 #PrepLife #CollegiateChic #FallFashion
