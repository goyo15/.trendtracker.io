Hey, VSCO girl, it’s time to break it down! This trend is all about chill vibes and saving the planet, one metal straw at a time. Oversized tees? Check. Scrunchies for days? Double check. But it’s not just about the clothes, it’s a whole lifestyle. Embracing a laid-back attitude and being eco-conscious is key. So, next time you see a girl with a hydro flask covered in stickers and a shell necklace, you know what’s up. It’s all about that VSCO aesthetic, being kind to the Earth, and staying effortlessly cool. So go ahead, rock those Birkenstocks and messy buns with pride. And don’t forget to spread those positive vibes like confetti. Stay authentic, stay eco-friendly, and keep being the VSCO queen that you are! #SaveTheTurtles🌊🐢✌️
