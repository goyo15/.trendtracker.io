# Relationships and Crushes — 2025-07-24

Hey fam, let’s talk about relationships and crushes, 'cause let’s be real – it’s always on our minds. Crushes can make our hearts race and our minds wander, but remember, it’s all about balance. Don’t lose yourself in someone who doesn’t see your worth.

Relationships? They can be the bomb or a total disaster. Communication is key, peeps. If they can’t handle your realness, they ain’t worth your time. Don’t settle for anything less than what you deserve.

And remember, self-love is the ultimate goal. Treat yourself like the queen or king you are, 'cause you deserve all the love and respect in the world. So, crush hard, love fiercely, but always have your own back first. Stay fab, stay fierce, and remember – you’re worth it all. Peace out, my peeps!
