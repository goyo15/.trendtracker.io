# Celebrity and pop culture satire — 2025-11-28

Hey fellow trendsetters! Let’s dish about celebrity and pop culture satire, because honestly, it’s the gift that keeps on giving. Satire is like that sassy best friend who always tells it like it is, but in a hilariously exaggerated way. When it comes to poking fun at celebs and pop culture, satire is the ultimate mic drop.

From SNL skits to meme accounts, nothing is off-limits in the world of satire. It’s all about taking a closer look at the glitz and glam of Hollywood and pointing out the absurdities in a way that makes us all laugh. Plus, it’s a reminder that even the biggest stars are just regular people (with really good lighting and filters).

So next time you’re scrolling through your feed, keep an eye out for some juicy satire on your fave celebs. It’s not just entertainment – it’s a whole mood. Stay snarky, my friends!✌️ #SatireSquad #SlayAllDay
