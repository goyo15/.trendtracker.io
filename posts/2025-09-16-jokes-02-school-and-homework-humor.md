# School and homework humor — 2025-09-16

Hey fam! Let’s talk about the ultimate struggle – school and homework humor. As much as we love to complain about assignments piling up like a game of Tetris, you gotta admit, there’s some hilarious stuff that goes down in the world of education.

Who else has turned in an assignment last minute, only for the teacher to extend the deadline? Classic. And let’s not forget those group projects where you end up doing all the work – where’s the fairness in that? Homework not done? Just blame it on the dog, works every time!

And how about the iconic moment when you completely forget about a test and have to improvise all your answers? Pure comedic gold. So, next time you’re drowning in schoolwork, remember to laugh it off and enjoy the chaotic hilarity that comes with being a student. Stay sharp, stay sassy! xo 💁🏻‍♀️✨ #SchoolLife #HomeworkHilarity
