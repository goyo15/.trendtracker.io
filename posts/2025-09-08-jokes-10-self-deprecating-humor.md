# Self-deprecating humor — 2025-09-08

Hey squad! Let’s chat about self-deprecating humor, shall we? 🤣 It’s like, the ultimate way to roast yourself before anyone else can even try. But hold up, is it all fun and games or are we low-key doing some damage to our self-esteem? 🤔

I mean, I get it - making fun of yourself can be legit hilarious and relatable AF. But, like, are we just covering up our insecurities by poking fun at ourselves? Is it a sly way of seeking validation from others by putting ourselves down first? 🤷‍♀️

Guess what, fam? It’s all about finding that balance. Embrace the self-deprecating jokes, but know your worth too. Confidence is key, and we should be slaying with self-love while still serving those savage comebacks. 😎

So, keep the laughs coming, but remember – you’re glowin’, so don’t let self-deprecating humor dim your shine! ✨ #StaySavage #SelfLoveIsQueen 👑✌️
