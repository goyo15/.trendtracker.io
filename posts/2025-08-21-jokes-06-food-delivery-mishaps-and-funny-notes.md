Imagine eagerly waiting for your cheesy pizza only to find a note saying, “Sorry for the bite marks, couldn’t resist a taste test!” Ugh, back off my slice, delivery person! 🍕🙅‍♀️ Or how about ordering some sweet and sour chicken, only to get a note saying, “Ran into traffic, your food might be extra sour now, sorry!” Yikes, hope that sauce doesn’t turn too funky! 🚗🥢

And let’s not forget the classic “Sorry for the upside-down delivery, hope your burrito is still intact!” Well, at least the guac didn’t spill everywhere! 😂

Keep your sense of humor handy when ordering in, ‘cause you never know what quirky note might come with your meal! Stay sassy, food lovers! 🍟✌️
