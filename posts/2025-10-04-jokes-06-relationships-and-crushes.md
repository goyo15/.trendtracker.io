# Relationships and crushes â€” 2025-10-04

Hey, my fellow teens! Let's talk crushes and relationships because let's be real, it's always on our minds. Crushes can make you feel like you're on cloud nine or have you stressing out big time. But here's the tea: don't let a crush define your worth! Your awesomeness isn't dependent on someone else liking you back.

When it comes to relationships, communication is key. If you're into someone, let them know! But remember, it's all about finding someone who respects and values you just as much as you do them. Don't settle for someone who doesn't see your worth.

And if things don't work out? It's not the end of the world, babe. There are plenty of fish in the sea, and you deserve someone who appreciates all the amazing things that make you, well, YOU.

So go out there, be confident, and remember that YOU are the star of your own show. ðŸ’– #CrushinAndThriving #RelationshipRealness
