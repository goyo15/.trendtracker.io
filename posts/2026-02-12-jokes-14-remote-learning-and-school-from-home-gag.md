# Remote learning and school-from-home gags — 2026-02-12

Hey, cool cats and kittens! So, who else is totally over this whole remote learning gig? 🙋‍♀️ I mean, can someone please explain how I’m supposed to pay attention in math class when my dog insists on barking every time the teacher starts talking? And don’t even get me started on the time my mom walked in on me during a Zoom call wearing a towel turban because I forgot to turn off my camera. 🙈 #mortified

But hey, let’s find the humor in all this chaos, shall we? My top school-from-home gag? Pretending to be a news anchor during virtual presentations, complete with a makeshift “studio” background and a serious reporter voice. 🎥🤓 Trust me, it never fails to make my classmates crack a smile.

Hang in there, fam. We’ll make it through this wacky world of remote learning together, one hilarious moment at a time. Stay fabulous, stay sassy! 💁‍♀️💕 #SchoolFromHomeShenanigans
