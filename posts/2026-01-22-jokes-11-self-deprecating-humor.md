Hey, squad! Let’s chat about self-deprecating humor, the ultimate skill in our meme-worthy world. Yeah, we all know the struggle is real, but making fun of ourselves? That's next-level! Trust me, a well-timed self-roast can have everyone rolling on the floor laughing.

But here’s the tea – there’s a fine line between self-deprecating humor and straight-up self-hate. So, honey, know your worth and keep it light. It’s all about poking fun at those awkward moments we all have, not tearing yourself down.
