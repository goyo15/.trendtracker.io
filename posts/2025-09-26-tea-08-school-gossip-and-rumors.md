# School gossip and rumors — 2025-09-26

Hey, fellow high school drama enthusiasts! Let's talk about everyone's favorite pastime: school gossip and rumors. 🗣️💬 We all know that gossip spreads faster than wildfire in the halls, right? Whether it's who's dating who, who got in trouble with the principal, or who wore what to the party last weekend, rumors never fail to entertain us during those boring math classes. But here's the thing: gossip can be harmful and damaging to others. Before you pass along that juicy piece of info, think about how it might affect someone else. Remember, spreading rumors doesn't make you cool or popular—it just shows that you're not above stooping to a lower level. So, let's try to keep the gossip to a minimum and focus on lifting each other up instead of tearing each other down. Stay classy, my friends! 😎✌️ #RumorControl #HighSchoolDrama
