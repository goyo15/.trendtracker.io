First up, the struggle of coordinating your mask with your outfit is all too real. We’ve all been there, trying to look chic while also staying safe, only to realize our mask clashes with everything. Can someone please make a mask that goes with every outfit? Next, let’s talk about mask tan lines. Seriously, I didn’t think tan lines could get any worse until masks came along.
