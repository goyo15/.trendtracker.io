# Teenage slang and trends — 2025-11-28

Hey fam, let’s talk about teenage slang and trends that are totally lit right now! From using “yeet” to express excitement to saying “I’m deceased” when something is hilarious, we are always coming up with new ways to communicate. And don’t even get me started on TikTok dances like the Renegade or the Savage Love! It’s all about staying on fleek and keeping up with the latest vibes.

But remember, slang comes and goes faster than you can say “sksksk”. It’s important to stay groovy while also keeping it real. And as trends evolve, it’s cool to embrace them but also stay true to yourself. So whether you’re rocking the latest streetwear or adding “stan” to everything you love, just do you, boo.

Stay woke, stay slaying, and keep being the epic trendsetter you are. Catch ya later, fam! *mic drop*
