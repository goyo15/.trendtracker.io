# Social media and influencers — 2025-09-15

Hey fam, let’s spill the tea ☕️ on social media and influencers – it’s a whole new world out here! We all know influencers are basically the royalty of the internet, right? But here’s the tea sis: sometimes it can all be a little too much. From perfect Insta feeds to flawless TikToks, it’s easy to get caught up in the comparison game.

Listen up, loves – social media is not always real life. It’s cool to be inspired by influencers and their awesome content, but remember to stay true to YOU. Don’t let the pressure of looking a certain way or having a certain lifestyle get you down.

You’re fierce just the way you are, no filters needed. Let’s keep it real on this wild ride through the influencer world, and remember to always stay true to yourself, queens and kings! 💖✨ #StayAuthentic #RealTalk
