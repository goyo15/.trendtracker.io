# Sports and fitness jokes — 2025-08-14

Hey there, fit fam! Let's take a break from squats and protein shakes to appreciate some sports and fitness jokes that will have you laughing 'til your abs hurt (hey, that's a workout, right?).

Why did the football coach go to the bank? To get his quarterback! 🏈💰

What do you call two birds on a treadmill? A pair of running shoes! 🐦👟

Why did the golfer bring two pairs of pants? In case he got a hole-in-one! ⛳️👖

And for my gym rats out there:

What do you call a fake noodle? An impasta! 🍝💪

Why did the bodybuilder bring a ladder to the gym? He heard the gym was a great place to "step up" his workout! 🏋️‍♂️🤣

So next time you're at the gym or on the field, remember to flex your muscles and your funny bone with these sports and fitness jokes. Keep shining bright, and keep those puns coming! Stay swole, my friends! 💪✨ #FitFamLaughs
