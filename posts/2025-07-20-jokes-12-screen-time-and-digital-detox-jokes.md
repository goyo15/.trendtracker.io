# Screen time and digital detox jokes â€” 2025-07-20

Hey squad, letâ€™s talk screen time and digital detox jokes! ðŸ“±ðŸ’» We all know we spend way too much time glued to our screens, whether itâ€™s scrolling through TikTok for hours or binge-watching Netflix until the sun comes up. ðŸ˜… But hey, we gotta find some humor in it, right? 

Like when your phone battery dies and youâ€™re forced to actually socialize with your family...weird, right? Or when you finally decide to do a digital detox and end up staring at a blank wall wondering what to do with your life. ðŸ¤ª And letâ€™s not forget the classic joke of telling your friends youâ€™re taking a break from social media, only to come back five minutes later because you couldnâ€™t handle the FOMO. ðŸ˜† 

So letâ€™s all take a moment to laugh at ourselves and our screen addiction, but remember, a little digital detox every now and then is actually good for the soul. Stay funny, stay relatable, and remember to give your eyes a break from the blue light! âœ¨ #ScreenTimeStruggles #DigitalDetoxLaughs
