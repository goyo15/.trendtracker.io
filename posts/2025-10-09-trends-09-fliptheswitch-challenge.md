Hey there, fellow teens! Let’s talk about the latest viral challenge taking over social media - the #FlipTheSwitch challenge. If you’ve been living under a rock and haven’t seen it yet, it involves two people in a room switching outfits and dancing to the Drake song “Nonstop” while doing a little light “switch” trick.

So, if you’re looking to have a good time and make your followers chuckle, give the #FlipTheSwitch challenge a spin! Let’s get swapping, peeps!
