What’s the vibe, my fellow teens? Let’s talk TikTok trends, the good, the cringe, and everything in between. From dance challenges that make you feel like a pro to viral challenges that make you question humanity, TikTok is a wild ride. 

If you’re like me, you’ve spent hours scrolling through the endless stream of creativity and chaos that is TikTok. One minute you’re laughing at a hilarious skit, the next you’re attempting a trending dance in your bedroom. Let’s face it, TikTok trends are equal parts addicting and exhausting.
