# VSCO girl aesthetic — 2025-12-26

Yo, so let’s talk about that VSCO girl aesthetic we see all over the gram these days. I’m talking about scrunchies, over-the-top Hydro Flasks, and those dang oversized t-shirts. And let’s not forget the Sksksks and the And I Oop! You feel me?

But hey, I gotta admit, there’s something kinda cool about the whole laid-back, environmentally conscious vibe these VSCO girls are all about. I mean, who wouldn’t want to save the turtles, am I right?

So, whether you’re a full-on VSCO girl or just vibing with some of the trends, remember to keep it real and stay true to yourself. And hey, if the sksksk helps you cope with that calc homework, then why not, right?

Just make sure to keep doing you, snap a few pics for the ‘gram, and remember to spread those positive vibes. Peace out, VSCO babes!
