# School and homework woes — 2026-01-20

Ugh, school and homework are the ultimate buzzkill 🙄 Why do teachers think we want to spend all day learning and all night doing homework? It’s like they don’t know we have LIVES outside of the classroom. And don’t even get me started on group projects – trying to coordinate with a bunch of people who couldn’t care less? No thanks.

I swear, teachers must have a secret contest going on to see who can assign the most work. It’s like they forget we have other classes to worry about too! And don’t even get me started on pop quizzes – how am I supposed to excel when I never know when I’m being tested?!

But hey, at the end of the day, we’re tough cookies. We’ll survive the school and homework woes and come out on top. Just gotta keep pushing through and remember that summer break is waiting for us on the other side ✌️ #SchoolStruggles #HomeworkDrama
