# VSCO girl aesthetic — 2025-10-14

Hey fam, let’s talk about that trending VSCO girl aesthetic that’s blowing up our feeds faster than you can say, “Save the turtles!” 🐢🌊 For those living under a rock, picture this: oversized tees, scrunchies, Hydro Flasks, Birkenstocks, and of course, the essential metal straws. It’s all about that laid-back, beachy vibe that screams "I’m chill, I care about the environment, and I look cute doing it." 🌺🌞 Whether you’re rocking the signature messy bun or snapping pics with a disposable camera, the VSCO girl aesthetic is all about embracing your natural beauty and channeling those carefree summer vibes year-round. So next time you see someone with a shell necklace or a stack of Pura Vida bracelets, just remember, they’re probably just trying to live their best VSCO life. Keep it vibes, keep it real, and stay hydrated my friends! 💖✌️ #VSCOgirl #Sksksk #AndIop #SaveTheTurtles
