# Trending hashtags or challenges on social media — 2026-01-11

Hey, fellow teens! 🌟 Let’s talk about trending hashtags and challenges on social media - love them or hate them, they’re here to stay! From #ThrowbackThursday to #OOTD to the latest dance challenges, they’re a fun way to connect with others and show off our creativity. But let’s not forget the power of these trends to raise awareness for important causes too, like the #BlackLivesMatter movement or the #IceBucketChallenge for ALS.

Just remember, not every trend is worth jumping on - some can be risky or even harmful. So use your judgment, stay safe, and don’t feel pressured to participate in something that doesn’t sit right with you.

Whether you’re a trendsetter or prefer to march to the beat of your own drum, social media trends are all about having fun, expressing yourself, and maybe even making a positive impact. So go ahead, get hashtagging, and don’t forget to do it with style! 💃🏽📱 #StayFabulous #TeenBlogger
