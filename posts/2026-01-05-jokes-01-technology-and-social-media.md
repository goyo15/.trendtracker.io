# Technology and social media — 2026-01-05

Hey squad, let’s talk about tech and social media! We all know our phones are practically glued to our hands, but have you ever stopped to think about how it’s affecting our lives? Yeah, it’s awesome to stay connected with our friends 24/7, but sometimes it feels like we’re all living in a digital bubble, you feel me? 

We’re constantly comparing ourselves to others’ highlight reels online, leading to major FOMO and insecurity. Plus, don’t even get me started on the pressure to maintain the perfect feed. It's exhausting! Let’s remember to balance our screen time with a healthy dose of IRL moments. 

So, next time you’re hanging with the crew, try putting down the phone and actually engaging in some real convo. You might be surprised at how refreshing it feels. Remember, tech is cool and all, but let’s not forget to keep it real. Stay woke, my peeps! ✌️ #TechTrap #IRLisCoolToo 📵
