# Nostalgic throwback jokes (early 2000s to early 2010s trends) — 2026-02-01

Hey there, my fellow nostalgists! Let's take a trip down memory lane and revisit the hilarious throwback jokes from the early 2000s to early 2010s that still have us cracking up. From the iconic "Charlie bit my finger" video to the infamous "dramatic chipmunk" meme, these gems defined our formative years and continue to bring a smile to our faces.

Remember the days when "Yo mama" jokes and "Rickrolling" were all the rage? Classic. And who can forget the legendary catchphrases like "It's over 9000!" from Dragon Ball Z, or the cringe-worthy but oh-so-funny "I like turtles" kid?

So, grab your flip phone, pop in that mix CD, and let's relive the simpler times when planking, Harlem Shake, and Trollface memes ruled the internet. Because sometimes, a good old throwback joke is all you need to brighten your day and remind you of the magic of growing up in the golden era of the internet. Stay rad, my friends! ✌️ #nostalgiavibes #throwbackjokes #GoodOlDays
