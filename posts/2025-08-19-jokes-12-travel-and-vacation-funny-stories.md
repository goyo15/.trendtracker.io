Hey fellow travelers and adventure seekers! Let’s dish about some hilarious vacation mishaps and travel tales that are guaranteed to make you LOL.

So picture this – I’m on a road trip with my fam, cruising down the highway blasting tunes, when suddenly my little sister realizes she left her favorite stuffed animal at home. Cue the dramatic meltdown in the backseat.

And let’s not forget the time we went camping and my dad forgot to pack the tent poles. Guess who ended up sleeping under the stars (and a sky full of mosquitoes)? Spoiler alert: it was me.

But the ultimate vacation fail goes to my bestie who tried to order gelato in Italy using some questionable hand gestures and accidentally ended up ordering a whole cheese platter instead. The look on her face was priceless!
