# Social media and technology jokes — 2026-01-01

Hey, squad! Let’s talk about social media and tech jokes – the memes that keep us laughing and eye-rolling at the same time. From “Sorry, I can’t hang out. My phone is at 1%” to “I don’t need a therapist, I have my Twitter followers”, these jokes hit differently when you know the struggle is real. 👀 And don’t even get me started on the classic “The only exercise I do is running out of storage on my phone”. We’ve all been there, am I right? But hey, these jokes not only make us giggle but also remind us to take a step back from our screens and appreciate the real-life moments. So next time you’re stress-scrolling through Instagram, remember to take a tech joke break and just laugh it off. Because in this digital world, a little humor goes a long way. Catch you on the flip side, fam! 📱✌️ #techhumor #socialmediamemes
