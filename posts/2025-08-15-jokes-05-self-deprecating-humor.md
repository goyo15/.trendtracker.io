# Self-deprecating humor â€” 2025-08-15

Hey, fam! Letâ€™s chat about self-deprecating humor â€“ you know, when we roast ourselves for a good laugh. ðŸ¤£ Itâ€™s all fun and games until it becomes a crutch. Sure, we all use it sometimes to bond with our squad, but when itâ€™s our go-to move, it can start messing with our self-esteem. Weâ€™re all queens and kings here, so why shade ourselves when we should be hyping each other up? ðŸ”¥ Remember, the vibes we put out into the universe bounce right back at us.

Next time you catch yourself making a self-deprecating joke, ask yourself: Am I truly laughing, or am I masking my insecurities? We all deserve love and respect, starting with ourselves. Own your shine, fam, and spread that positivity like confetti! ðŸ’– #SelfLoveSquad #PositiveVibesOnly
