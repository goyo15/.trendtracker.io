# Environmental and climate change humor — 2025-11-07

Hey my eco-conscious pals! Let’s talk about a topic that doesn’t get enough love – environmental and climate change humor. Yeah, you heard me right, it’s time to lighten up and crack a joke about our melting ice caps and dying forests.

But wait, why should we even joke about such serious stuff? Well, humor is a powerful tool to raise awareness and start important conversations. It can make these big issues more approachable and show that we’re not just a bunch of doom-and-gloom activists.

So, next time you’re feeling overwhelmed by the state of the planet, why not share a meme about polar bears doing yoga on a melting iceberg or a funny comic strip about recycling? Laughter is contagious, and who knows, it might just inspire someone else to take action too.

Let’s use humor to spread the message and keep fighting the good fight for our planet. After all, we can save the Earth and still have a good chuckle along the way. #EcoJokesFTW 🌍✌️
