# VSCO girl energy revival — 2025-07-20

Hey there, fellow VSCO girls and boys! 🌿 Are we seeing a VSCO girl energy revival happening right now or what? It seems like the Hydro Flask hydration stations are never-ending, scrunchies are making a major comeback, and we’re all obsessed with that laid-back beachy vibe. And let’s not forget about the iconic oversized T-shirts and Birkenstocks combo that’s been spotted everywhere lately.

I don’t know about you, but I’m totally here for this resurgence of VSCO girl energy. It’s all about living that eco-friendly, carefree lifestyle and embracing our natural selves. Who wouldn’t want to rock a messy bun, oversized hoodie, and a reusable straw all day, every day?

So, grab your reusable tote, swipe on some lip gloss, and let’s bring back that VSCO girl energy like it never left. Let’s save the turtles, spread positivity, and show the world what it truly means to be a VSCO girl in 2021. 🌊✌️ #SaveTheTurtles #VSCOgirlRevival
