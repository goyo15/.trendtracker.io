# Revenge plots and betrayals between friends — 2025-10-09

Hey fam, let’s chat about revenge plots and betrayals between friends. We’ve all been there, right? It sucks when someone you trust stabs you in the back, but retaliation isn’t always the answer. Sure, it’s tempting to cook up some juicy revenge scheme, but is it really worth it? Sometimes the best revenge is just moving on and living your best life.

In the end, true friends don’t betray each other. If someone constantly brings drama and negativity into your life, it may be time to reevaluate that friendship. Remember, you deserve friends who lift you up, not bring you down.

So instead of scheming for revenge, focus on surrounding yourself with positive vibes and good energy. Life’s too short for toxic friendships, so cut out the drama and keep it real with the people who genuinely care about you. Stay true to yourself, fam! ✌🏼 #RealFriendsOnly
