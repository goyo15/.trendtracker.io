# Fashion and trends jokes - poking fun at current fashion trends and styles — 2025-08-10

Hey fashionistas and trendsetters, let’s talk about fashion jokes that have us LOL-ing at some of the wild trends out there right now. Like seriously, who decided that tiny sunglasses were back in style? I feel like a bug with those on my face! And can we talk about dad shoes making a comeback? I mean, my dad thinks he's a trendsetter now, rocking his chunky sneakers from the '90s.

Oh, and don’t even get me started on those clear plastic boots. Like, are we trying to make our feet sweat or what? And let’s not forget the oh-so-classic “ugly” sneakers that are somehow a must-have. I swear, it looks like we raided our grandpa's closet!

Fashion can be fun and all, but sometimes you just have to laugh at the craziness of it all. Stay fashionable, stay trendy, and most importantly, stay you - even if that means skipping out on the latest wacky trend. #FashionFails #TrendyOrTacky
