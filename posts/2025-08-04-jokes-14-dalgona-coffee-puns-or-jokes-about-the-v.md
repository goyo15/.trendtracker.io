# Dalgona coffee: Puns or jokes about the viral coffee trend that was popular during the pandemic — 2025-08-04

Alright, fam, let’s spill the tea – or should I say *coffee* – on the Dalgona coffee trend that had us all whipped during lockdown. I don’t know about you, but I was *brewing* with excitement to try this viral sensation that took over our Insta feeds faster than you could say “caramel macchiato”.

But let’s be real, the puns and jokes that came along with the Dalgona coffee craze were almost as addictive as the drink itself. I mean, who could resist a “whipping up some trouble” pun or a “life’s too short for bad coffee, so whip it good” joke? It was all part of the *daily grind*, am I right?

So, whether you’re a coffee connoisseur or just a caffeine enthusiast, let’s raise our mugs to a trend that brought some much-needed *espresso* joy into our lives during the pandemic. Stay brew-tiful, peeps! ☕✨
