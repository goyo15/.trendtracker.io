# School scandals and rumors — 2025-11-07

Hey fam, let’s spill the tea on all the latest school scandals and rumors that have got everyone whispering in the hallways. 🐸☕️ From secret hookups behind the bleachers to teachers caught red-handed grading unfairly, our school is basically a reality TV show minus the cameras. It’s like Mean Girls meets Gossip Girl but with a touch of Riverdale drama, am I right? And don’t even get me started on the rumor mill – one minute you’re besties with someone, the next they’re spreading lies about you faster than you can say “OMG”. But hey, who needs Netflix when you’ve got all this entertainment right in your own backyard? So grab your snacks, sit back, and watch as the scandals unfold because high school drama never looked so good. Keep shining, queens and kings, and remember: stay dramatic but always stay classy. XOXO 💋✨
