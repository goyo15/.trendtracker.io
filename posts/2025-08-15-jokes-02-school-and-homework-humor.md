# School and homework humor — 2025-08-15

Hey there, fellow teens! Let’s talk about school and homework humor - because let’s face it, we could all use a good laugh to survive those long study sessions and tough tests.

Homework? More like “home-don’t!” Am I right, or am I right? And don’t even get me started on group projects – it’s like trying to herd cats while juggling flaming torches.

But you know what’s the best part? When your teacher assigns a mountain of work on a Friday and expects it back on Monday. Seriously, do they think we have a time-turner like Hermione Granger or something?

And let’s not forget those classic excuses for not doing homework: “My dog ate it” or “I left it on the bus” – nice try, but teachers have heard it all, folks.

So next time you’re drowning in assignments, just remember to keep your sense of humor intact. Because as they say, laughter is the best study buddy! Keep slaying those deadlines, my friends.
