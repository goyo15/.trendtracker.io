# Self-Deprecating Humor — 2025-10-24

Hey, party people! Let's talk about self-deprecating humor. It's like that friend who always shows up with the best roast jokes about themselves. Sure, it can be hilarious and relatable, but girl, don't let it become your default setting! 

Self-deprecating humor is like seasoning – a little sprinkle here and there can add flavor, but too much and your whole dish tastes off. Remember, you're fabulous just the way you are, so why sell yourself short for a laugh? 

So, next time you catch yourself about to crack a "I'm so clumsy, I tripped over my own shoelaces" joke, maybe switch it up and flaunt your killer dance moves instead. Own your quirks and shine bright like the diamond you are! Let's keep the humor fun and light, without dimming our own sparkle. Stay sassy, stay fabulous! Peace out! ✌️ #OwnYourAwesomeness
