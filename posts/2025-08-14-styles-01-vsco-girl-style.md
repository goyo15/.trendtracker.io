# VSCO Girl Style — 2025-08-14

Hey fam, let’s spill the tea on the VSCO girl trend! 🌊🌿🤙🏻 From oversized tees and scrunchies to Hydro Flasks and metal straws, these girls are all about saving the turtles and serving those beachy vibes. It's all about that laid-back, carefree aesthetic that screams, "I woke up like this, but also put in a lot of effort." 💁🏻‍♀️✨ And don't get it twisted, Birkenstocks and Fjällräven Kånken backpacks are a must for completing the look.

But hey, let’s not hate, let’s appreciate! ✌🏻💕 Rocking the VSCO girl style is all about spreading positivity, being eco-conscious, and living your best life, one beach wave at a time. So grab your Scrunchies, slip on those oversized Ts, and don’t forget to save the turtles on your way out! 🐢🌊 #Sksksk #AndIOop #SaveTheTurtles
