# Cottagecore - a romantic, vintage-inspired style featuring flowy dresses, florals, and earthy tones. — 2025-11-26

Hey fam, let's talk about #Cottagecore – the dreamy fashion trend that's taking over our Instagram feeds faster than you can say “vintage vibes”! 🌿🌻✨

Think flowy dresses that make you feel like you're frolicking through a wildflower meadow, earthy tones that scream cozy cabin vibes, and all the florals your grandma's wallpaper dreams of. Cottagecore is like stepping into a 19th-century painting, but with Wi-Fi and avocado toast.

Whether you're into picnics in fields, gardening in your backyard, or just pretending you live in a quaint countryside cottage (thanks, Zoom backgrounds), this aesthetic is all about embracing simplicity and nature. Bonus points if you can pull off a perfectly messy braid and rock some vintage lace-up boots.

So, if you're keen on rocking a look that's part fairy-tale princess, part hipster farmer, Cottagecore might just be your jam this season. Stay dreamy, my darlings! 🌸💫 #CottagecoreCutie #VintageVibes #NatureNurturer
