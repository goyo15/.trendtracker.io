# "VSCO girl" aesthetic and fashion trends — 2025-08-31

Hey trendy peeps! Let’s talk about the VSCO girl aesthetic, aka the ultimate style vibe taking over social media. From oversized t-shirts to scrunchies, metal straws to Hydro Flasks, the VSCO girl trend is all about that laid-back, eco-friendly vibe. Who knew saving the turtles could look so chic?

Rocking a messy bun, some Birkenstocks, and a shell necklace? You’re basically a VSCO queen. Don’t forget to throw in some stickers on your laptop and always be ready for a beach day photoshoot. And of course, the infamous “and I oop” catchphrase is a must-have accessory.

Whether you’re sippin’ on some iced coffee or heading to a beach clean-up, the VSCO girl look is all about embracing those carefree, nature-loving vibes. So grab your reusable water bottle and embrace your inner VSCO girl. Stay trendy, stay true to you! ✌️🌊🐢 #VSCOgirl #Sksksk #SaveTheTurtles
