# VSCO Girls — 2025-12-09

Hey, fellow Gen Zers! Today, let's spill the tea on VSCO girls. 🐢🌺💫 These beachy, laid-back gals are all about oversized tees, scrunchies, and Hydro Flasks. But is it just a style trend or a whole lifestyle? 🤔 Some say it's just a phase, while others swear by their save-the-turtles mentality. Personally, I'm all for promoting eco-consciousness, but let's not forget to keep it real. After all, saving the planet is more than just sipping from a metal straw. So, are VSCO girls just a bunch of basic baddies flexing their seaweed hair masks and friendship bracelets? Or are they onto something greater with their #sksksk and 🌊 emojis? Whatever your take, one thing's for sure: VSCO girls are here to stay... at least until the next TikTok trend rolls around. Are you in on the VSCO girl vibe or swiping left? Let me know in the comments! ✌️🌈 #StaySnazzy #VibeCheck
