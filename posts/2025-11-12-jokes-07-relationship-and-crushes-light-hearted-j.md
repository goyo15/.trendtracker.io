# Relationship and Crushes: Light-hearted jokes about crushes, dating, and relationships in a teen context. — 2025-11-12

Hey, fam! Let’s spill the tea on crushes and relationships with some light-hearted jokes that’ll have you LOL-ing for days. 🤣

When my crush walks by, I turn into a professional spy, casually glancing in their direction like it’s NBD. 🕵️‍♀️ But let’s be real, inside I’m panicking like a squirrel in a thunderstorm. 🐿️⛈️

Dating tip: If your crush asks you out and you’re feeling nervous, just remember to be yourself. Unless you’re a potato, then maybe consider being a cute potato at least. 🥔💃

Relationship status: If Netflix and PJs were a status option, that’s where you’d find me most Friday nights. And you know what? No shame in that game! 📺🛋️

So, whether you’re crushing hard, swiping left and right, or just enjoying the single life, remember to keep it light, keep it funny, and never take those teenage relationship dramas too seriously. Stay fabulous, friends! ✨👫 #RelationshipGoals #TeenHumor
