# "Devious Licks": A trend where students vandalize school property and steal items, leading to widespread controversy and school disciplinary actions. — 2025-12-13

Hey babes, let’s chat about this whole “devious licks” trend that’s been blowing up recently. I mean, seriously, who thought trashing school property and stealing stuff was a cool idea? Uh, definitely not me.

Sure, we all get that school can be a drag sometimes, but vandalizing and stealing? Not the move. It’s downright reckless and disrespectful. Plus, hello, it’s illegal!

Not to mention the consequences - hello, school disciplinary actions and possible criminal charges. Is that really worth a few likes and views on social media? I don’t think so.

Let’s show some class, fam, and not get caught up in this nonsense. Respect your school, respect your education, and don’t fall for the hype. Keep it real and stay outta trouble. Trust me, it’s a better look, and way cooler in the long run. Peace out, squad! ✌️ #NoDeviousLicks #RespectYourSchool
