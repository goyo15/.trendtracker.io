# School and homework jokes — 2026-01-31

Hey fellow students! Let's talk about school and homework jokes - because let's face it, we all need a good laugh to survive the never-ending cycle of assignments and exams.

Why did the math book look sad? Because it had too many problems.

Homework? More like home-never-ending-work, am I right?

Teacher: "Why did you not do your homework?" Me: "Well, I didn't want to add to the already overwhelming global paper consumption."

Some days, attempting homework feels like trying to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded - confusing and frustrating.

But hey, at least we can all bond over the collective suffering of school deadlines and group project drama, right?

So next time you're drowning in schoolwork, remember to take a break, share a joke with a friend, and just keep swimming through the sea of homework. We got this, fam! ✨#SchoolHumor #HomeworkStruggles #TeenBlogger
