# Parents on Zoom Calls — 2025-12-20

Ugh, parents on Zoom calls – am I right?! It’s like they suddenly forget how to act like normal humans the second that camera turns on. From walking around shirtless in the background to yelling at siblings to BE QUIET, it’s a whole new level of embarrassing. And don’t even get me started on the awkward moments when they accidentally unmute themselves and start talking about the most random things. Like, please, spare us the details of your latest DIY project, Mom. We’re just trying to survive virtual school without the added cringe factor. But hey, at least we get a good laugh out of it, right? And let’s not forget the endless eye-rolls and exaggerated sighs we can unleash when they ask us to help them troubleshoot their tech issues. It’s a whole new world out there, folks – and our parents are front and center, stealing the show on Zoom calls everywhere.
