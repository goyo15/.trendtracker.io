# Slang and Urban Dictionary Terms — 2026-01-28

Hey fam, let’s spill the tea on slang and Urban Dictionary terms - the OG way for us teens to keep up with the latest lingo. It’s like trying to crack a secret code, but once you do, you’re legit on fleek. From “savage” to “lit” to “stan,” our vocab is constantly evolving, just like our Insta feeds. And let’s not forget the Urban Dictionary rabbit hole - where you can find the wildest, most extra definitions ever. It’s a whole vibe! But remember, not all slang is fire - some can be lowkey cringey or even straight-up yikes. So next time you wanna flex your slang game, just make sure you’re not being extra AF. Stay woke and keep it 100, my fellow cool cats. ’Til next time, stay slayin’! As they say, “Live, laugh, and slay.” Peace out! ✌️ #SlangSquad #UrbanDictionaryVibes 📚🔥
