# VSCO girl look — 2025-10-27

Hey fellow teens, let's talk about the VSCO girl look that has taken over our feeds! From scrunchies to hydro flasks, this trend is all about embracing a laid-back, beachy vibe. The key to achieving the perfect VSCO girl aesthetic? Oversized t-shirts, Birkenstocks, and of course, that signature messy bun.

But let’s not forget the crucial accessories: you can’t call yourself a VSCO girl without your trusty reusable straw and some shell jewelry. And of course, we can't leave out the iconic Fjällräven Kånken backpack – it’s practically a VSCO girl staple.

So, embrace your inner VSCO girl, throw on those friendship bracelets, and don’t forget to capture it all on your VSCO app. And remember, it’s all about the scrunchies, the good vibes, and of course, saving the turtles. Stay trendy, stay VSCO! #Sksksk #And I oop 🐢✌️
