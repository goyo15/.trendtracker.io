# Fashion blogger M was criticized for promoting a fast fashion brand known for unethical labor practices, causing a social media backlash. — 2025-10-06

Hey fam, let’s talk about the drama that went down in the fashion world recently. So, fashion blogger M thought it was a good idea to promote a fast fashion brand with a shady rep for exploiting workers. Um, not a cute move, sis.

I get it, we all love a bargain and trendy clothes, but we can’t turn a blind eye to the ugly truth behind some brands. No one should suffer for the sake of our style game, periodt.

Now, M’s facing a major social media clapback for endorsing this brand. Oof, talk about a major fashion faux pas. It’s crucial to use our platform for good and support ethical fashion brands that respect people and the planet.

Let’s keep it real, babes. Fashion is fun, but it shouldn’t come at the cost of someone else’s well-being. Stay woke and slay responsibly, okay? #ethicalfashion #choosewisely ✌🏽🌿🛍️
