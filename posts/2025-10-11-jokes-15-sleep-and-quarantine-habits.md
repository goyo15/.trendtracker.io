# Sleep and quarantine habits — 2025-10-11

Hey, squad! Let’s talk quarantine habits, specifically SLEEP. I know we love our late-night TikTok scrolls, but let’s be real - our sleep schedules are all over the place. Who else has gone from binging Netflix till 3 am to waking up at 2 pm? 🙋‍♀️ It’s all fun and games until we’re exhausted during virtual classes.

It’s time to get our Zzz’s in check! Try setting a bedtime alarm, putting the phone away an hour before bed, and creating a cozy sleep environment. Trust me, your skin and mood will thank you for it. Plus, who doesn’t love a good dream to escape from reality these days?

Let’s prioritize self-care, starting with our sleep schedule. After all, we deserve to feel rested and rejuvenated during these crazy times. Now, go catch those Zzz’s, fam! 💤 #SleepGoals #QuarantineHabits
