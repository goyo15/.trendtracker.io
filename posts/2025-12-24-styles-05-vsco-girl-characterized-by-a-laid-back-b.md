# VSCO girl - Characterized by a laid-back, beachy vibe with items like scrunchies, oversized T-shirts, and Hydro Flask water bottles. — 2025-12-24

Hey fam, let’s talk about the VSCO girl trend that's totally taking over the gram 💁‍♀️📸. These girls are all about that laid-back, beachy vibe, rockin’ oversized tees, scrunchies, and Hydro Flask water bottles like it’s nobody’s business. They’re all about the eco-friendly life, sippin’ on their reusable straws and saving the turtles 🐢. Let’s not forget the iconic ‘and I oop... sksksk’ that’s basically become their cultural slogan – it’s like their secret language or something 🤫. So if you catch a glimpse of a girl with messy bun, Birkenstocks, and a reusable bag – chances are, you’ve spotted yourself a VSCO girl in the wild. Love it or hate it, they’re here to stay and they’re making a statement, one scrunchie at a time 🌊✌️. Stay trendy, my dudes! #VSCOgirlforlife #SaveTheTurtles ✨🌸🐚
