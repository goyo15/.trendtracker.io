# Relationship and dating quips — 2025-08-11

Hey, QTs! 💖 Let’s talk about relationships and dating quips because, let’s be real, love can be a rollercoaster! 🎢 From ghosting to friend-zoning, the dating world is like a battlefield littered with mixed signals and unanswered texts! 😒 But hey, we’re not here to dwell on the negatives! 🚫 Let’s focus on the good stuff - like butterflies in your stomach when your crush texts you first or that feeling of warmth when they hold your hand. 🦋✨ Remember, communication is key! 🗝️ Don’t assume, just ask! And if things don’t work out, it’s okay! 💔 Breakups suck but they also make you stronger. Embrace the single life and focus on self-love because you are a QUEEN/KING! 👑 Keep swiping, keep smiling, and never settle for anything less than you deserve! XOXO, your dating guru. 😘💋 #RelationshipQuips #DatingLife
