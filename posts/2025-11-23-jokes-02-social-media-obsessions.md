# Social Media Obsessions — 2025-11-23

Hey there, fellow teens! Let’s talk about social media obsessions – we’ve all been there, scrolling through Instagram for hours or refreshing our Snapchat stories every five minutes. It’s easy to get sucked into the virtual world of likes and comments, but it’s important to remember that real life is happening outside of our screens too!

Don’t let your self-worth be defined by the number of followers you have or the amount of likes on your post. Social media is a highlight reel, not real life. So, take breaks, go outside, hang out with friends in person, and remember that there is so much more to you than what you post online.

It’s okay to enjoy social media, but don’t let it consume you. Find a balance that works for you and focus on living in the moment. Your true worth is not measured by your online presence – it’s all about who you are offline. Stay grounded, stay true to yourself, and don’t let the social media craze control you. Peace out! ✌️ #RealLifeMatters
