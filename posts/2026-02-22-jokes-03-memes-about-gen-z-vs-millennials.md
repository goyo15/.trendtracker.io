# Memes about Gen Z vs. Millennials — 2026-02-22

Hey internet fam! Can we talk about these memes pitting Gen Z against millennials? I mean, who knew a simple avocado toast could cause so much drama, right?

Sure, there are differences between the generations, but can we all just chill for a minute? Gen Z may be all about the TikToks and VSCO filters, while millennials grew up with MySpace and AIM (throwback, am I right?), but does it really matter in the grand scheme of things?

Let’s spread some positivity instead of spreading memes. We all have something unique to bring to the table, whether it’s our love for skinny jeans or our obsession with oversized hoodies. At the end of the day, we’re all just trying to navigate this crazy world together.

So, let’s embrace the diversity of each generation and celebrate what makes us all different. And hey, maybe we can even teach each other a thing or two along the way. Stay cool, fam! ✌️ #GenZ #Millennials #PeaceOut
