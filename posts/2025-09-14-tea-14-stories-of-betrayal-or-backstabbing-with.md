# Stories of betrayal or backstabbing within social circles — 2025-09-14

Hey, fam! Let’s spill some tea on betrayal and backstabbing in our social circles. 🐍 We all know that one friend who is always ready to snake their way into drama, right?

It’s like a game of “Survivor” trying to navigate these friendships without getting blindsided. Whether it’s secrets being spilled, shady rumors spread, or friendships suddenly turning cold, betrayal is part of the messy mix of teenage life.

But hey, here’s the real tea – not everyone is out to stab you in the back. Hold tight to those true friends who have your back, even when the drama hits the fan. And remember, loyalty is a two-way street – be the kind of friend you want to have.

So, let’s keep it real and watch out for those snakes in the grass. Stay true to yourself, stick with the ones who lift you up, and don’t let the drama drag you down. Stay slaying, my friends! 💅🔥 #GossipGirlOut
