# Self-deprecating humor — 2025-08-12

Hey fellow teens! Let’s talk about self-deprecating humor – you know, the kind of jokes we make at our own expense. It’s like the ultimate form of self-roast, am I right? But here’s the thing – while it can be hilarious to poke fun at ourselves, we gotta remember it’s all fun and games until it starts affecting our self-esteem.

I’m all for laughing at my own clumsiness or bad hair days, but when those jokes start making me feel lousy about myself, it’s time to check myself before I wreck myself. So, let’s keep the self-deprecating humor light and remember that we’re awesome just the way we are – flaws and all.

So, sure, let’s keep the self-roasts coming, but let’s also remember to show ourselves some love and know that we’re all perfectly imperfect. Stay sassy, stay fabulous, and keep those self-deprecating jokes in check! ✌️🤣 #LoveYourself #StayFabulous
