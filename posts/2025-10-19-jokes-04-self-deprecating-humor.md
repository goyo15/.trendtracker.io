# Self-Deprecating Humor — 2025-10-19

Hey, fam! Let’s talk about self-deprecating humor, the OG of comedy. No shame in poking fun at yourself, right? It’s basically a power move. But here’s the tea – tread lightly! Self-roasting is cool, but too much can be a vibe killer. It’s all about balance, like adding just the right amount of sugar to your coffee.

Being able to laugh at yourself shows mad confidence. Embracing your flaws and quirks is a flex in itself. Just remember, your worth ain’t defined by your jokes. Keep it real, stay positive, and slay that self-love game. So, next time you drop a self-dep zinger, own that moment. Confidence is key, babes. Stay sassy and keep slaying! ✌️ #SelfLove #NoShameInMyGame
