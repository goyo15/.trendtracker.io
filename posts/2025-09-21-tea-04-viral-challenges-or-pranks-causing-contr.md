# Viral challenges or pranks causing controversy â€” 2025-09-21

Hey, fam! Let's talk about viral challenges and pranks causing major drama lately. From dangerous stunts to harmful pranks, it seems like some peeps are taking things way too far for the views. Sure, the thrill of going viral is real, but at what cost?

Like, the whole TikTok skull-breaker challenge? Not cool, peeps! Itâ€™s like some are willing to risk serious injury just for a laugh on the â€˜gram. And donâ€™t even get me started on those cringe-worthy fake pregnancy pranks. Not funny at all!

Let's keep it real, squad. Being funny or popular shouldnâ€™t mean putting ourselves or others at risk. Let's think twice before jumping on the latest viral bandwagon, and instead use our online presence for good vibes and positive content. Stay safe, stay smart, and keep it real, peeps! Peace out! ðŸ¤™ #PositiveVibesOnly #ThinkBeforeYouPrank
