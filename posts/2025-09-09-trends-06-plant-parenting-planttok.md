# Plant parenting (PlantTok) — 2025-09-09

Hey, PlantTok is taking over my feed and I’m totally here for it! 🌿📱🌿 From Monstera Mondays to Fern Fridays, it’s like a whole plant-themed party every day. Who knew plant care could be so hypnotizing?! Watching those propagation videos is so satisfying, like ASMR for my eyes. And don’t get me started on the plant hauls – my wishlist just keeps growing! 📝🪴💸 Whether you’re a seasoned plant parent or a newbie like me, PlantTok is the place to be for inspo and tips. Plus, the plant community is so supportive and full of green thumbs ready to help. So, if your room is in need of a little leafy makeover, hop on the PlantTok train – your plant babies will thank you! 🚂🌱💚 #PlantParenthood #AddictedToGreen #TikTokObsessed
