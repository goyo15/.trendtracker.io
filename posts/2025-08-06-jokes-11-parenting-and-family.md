# Parenting and Family — 2025-08-06

Hey, fam! Let’s talk about the wild rollercoaster ride that is parenting and family. I mean, we all love our parents (most of the time), but let’s be real, they can drive us crazy too. From the never-ending curfews to the constant “have you done your homework” reminders, parents just don’t seem to get it sometimes.

But hey, let’s give credit where it’s due. Our parents have our backs, even when we mess up big time. They’re the ones cheering us on at every game, concert, or performance, and they’re the first to celebrate our victories with us. Yeah, they may embarrass us in front of our friends and not understand our obsession with TikTok dances, but at the end of the day, they’re our biggest fans.

So, shoutout to all the parents out there trying their best, and to us teens, let’s cut them some slack and show them some love once in a while. After all, family is forever, even when they’re driving us crazy. #familylove #parentingwoes
