# School and virtual learning — 2025-11-16

Hey fellow teens, let’s talk about the virtual learning situation we’ve been dealing with lately. School from home sounded kinda cool at first, but now it’s a whole different story. More like a never-ending Netflix binge of Zoom calls, am I right? 😅

Missing out on the cafeteria lunches, hallway gossip, and actual human interaction is a total bummer. And let’s not even get started on the WiFi issues and those dreaded group projects that never seem to end.

But hey, we’re resilient and can handle anything that comes our way. We’ve adapted to this new normal like pros, even though we'd much rather be chilling with our friends in the quad.

So, hang in there, keep pushing through those virtual classes, and remember, we’ll all have one heck of a story to tell someday. Stay strong, stay connected, and don’t forget to hit that mute button when your little brother starts blasting music in the background. Peace out! 🤘✌️
