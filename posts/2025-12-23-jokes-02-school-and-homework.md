# School and homework — 2025-12-23

Hey squad,

Let’s talk about the dreaded duo: school and homework. Ugh, am I right? School can be super overwhelming, with lectures, assignments, and tests coming at us like nobody’s business. And don’t even get me started on homework - the never-ending pile of worksheets and essays that always seem to be due tomorrow.

But hey, here’s the kicker - staying on top of schoolwork is key to slaying the academic game. So, here’s the tea: prioritize, stay organized, and avoid the last-minute cramming (guilty as charged). Trust me, it’s worth it in the end.

And remember, it’s totally okay to ask for help when you need it. Your teachers and friends got your back. So, power through those assignments, ace those exams, and remember, you got this!

Keep slaying,
