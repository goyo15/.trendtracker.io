# Self-care routines - #selfcare — 2025-09-03

Hey, fam! Let’s talk about #selfcare because, let’s be real, we all need it in our lives! Taking care of yourself is more than just face masks and bubble baths (although those are totally valid options, of course). It’s about prioritizing your mental health and well-being. 

Whether it’s journaling, going for a run, or simply taking a few minutes to breathe, finding what works for you is key. So, let’s ditch the idea that self-care is selfish – it’s a necessity. Say it with me: self-care is not selfish, it’s self-love! 

It’s all about finding those small moments in the day to show yourself some love and kindness. Trust me, you deserve it! So, take a break from the chaos of life and make time for yourself. You’re worth it, always. #selfcare for the win! ✌️💕
