# VSCO girl style â€” 2025-08-16

Hey, fellow teens! Today, let's chat about VSCO girl style â€“ the ultimate laid-back, beachy vibe that's taking over our feeds. From scrunchies to oversized t-shirts and Birkenstocks, this trend is all about being effortlessly cool and eco-friendly. Don't forget the Hydro Flask and metal straws to complete the look!

But let's be real here, is VSCO girl style just a trend or a lifestyle? With its emphasis on environmental consciousness and self-care, maybe it's a little bit of both. Plus, who doesn't love a good excuse to rock a messy bun and a shell necklace?

Whether you fully embrace the VSCO girl aesthetic or just sprinkle a little bit into your wardrobe, remember that style is all about expressing yourself. So throw on those thrifted shorts and embrace your inner beach babe â€“ because being true to yourself is always in fashion. Stay snazzy, lovelies!ðŸ’•ðŸŒŠ #VSCOgirlvibes #Stayauthentic
