# Minion TikToks — 2025-09-24

Hey guys, let’s talk about Minion TikToks – the good, the bad, and the cringeworthy. Look, I love those little yellow dudes as much as the next person, but some of these TikToks are just too much. I get it, they’re cute and funny, but there’s a fine line between fun and straight-up weird.

Don’t get me wrong, there are some seriously creative Minion TikToks out there that make me laugh out loud. Whether they’re dancing to the latest viral song or reenacting iconic movie scenes, some creators really have a knack for making these little guys shine.

But then you have the ones that make you question everything. I’m talking about the ones where they’re lip-syncing to inappropriate songs or doing weird challenges. Like, do we really need to see Minions twerking? I don’t think so.

So, let’s enjoy the cute and creative Minion TikToks out there, but maybe let’s leave the weird and cringey ones in 2020, shall we?
