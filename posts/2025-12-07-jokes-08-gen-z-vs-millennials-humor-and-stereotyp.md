# Gen Z vs. Millennials humor and stereotypes — 2025-12-07

Hey, fellow cool cats and internet addicts! Let’s talk about the epic showdown between Gen Z and Millennials when it comes to humor and stereotypes. We all know Millennials love their avocado toast and side parts, while Gen Z is all about TikTok dances and VSCO girls.

Some say Millennials are too obsessed with nostalgia and have a weird obsession with houseplants, while Gen Z is constantly roasted for their endless use of slang terms and their addiction to memes. But hey, at least we can all agree that both generations share a love for self-deprecating humor and calling out the absurdities of life.

So, whether you’re a Millennial still trying to figure out TikTok or a Gen Z’er confused by all the ’90s references, let’s just embrace our unique humor styles and remember that at the end of the day, we’re all just trying to find the next viral tweet or meme to make us giggle. Keep the laughs coming, and may the best generation win! #SlayingTheHumorGame 💁‍♂️🔥
