# VSCO Girl - Relaxed and beachy style popularized on social media — 2025-07-20

What’s up my fellow teens! Alright, let’s talk about the VSCO Girl trend that’s blowing up our feed faster than you can say "sksksk and I oop." This relaxed, beachy vibe is all about embracing the laid-back life with scrunchies, oversized tees, and Birkenstocks. But let’s not forget the Hydro Flask and metal straws – saving the turtles, am I right?

Personally, I’m digging this trend because it’s all about being chill, embracing nature, and being eco-friendly. Plus, who doesn’t love a good excuse to wear a ton of bracelets and carry around a mini backpack? It’s the ultimate summer aesthetic that’s got us dreaming of sandy beaches and carefree days.

So, whether you’re already a card-carrying VSCO Girl or just dabbling in the trend, remember to stay true to yourself and have fun with your style. And hey, if anyone tries to hate, just give them a big ol’ “and I oop” and keep on sksksk-ing your way to VSCO perfection. Peace out, VSCO babes!
