# VSCO girl style — 2025-10-18

Hey fam, let’s talk about the VSCO girl style that’s been taking over Instagram feeds everywhere. From oversized t-shirts to scrunchies galore, this trend isn’t just a look, it’s a whole vibe. The key to nailing the VSCO girl aesthetic? Keep it effortless, laid-back, and eco-friendly. Hydro flasks, metal straws, and reusable tote bags are must-haves for any VSCO girl on the go. Don’t forget your Birkenstocks and shell necklaces to complete the look. And of course, your hair should always be perfectly messy in a messy bun or loose waves. Embracing the VSCO girl style is all about chilling with your squad, capturing the perfect sunset pic, and spreading positive vibes. So grab your save the turtles bracelet, hop on your skateboard, and let’s save the world one scrunchie at a time. Stay groovy, VSCO girls! ✌️🌊🐢 #sksksk
