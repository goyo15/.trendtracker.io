# Gen Z vs. Millennials jokes — 2026-02-02

Hey there, fellow Gen Z-ers! Let’s talk about the ongoing battle of Gen Z vs. Millennials jokes. Sure, those older Millennials love to tease us about our avocado toast and TikTok addiction, but guess what? We can dish it right back! 🥑💃 

Millennials may think they’re the kings and queens of nostalgia with their Tamagotchis and boy bands, but we’ve got our own trends that are just as iconic (hello, VSCO girls and Y2K fashion comeback!). And let’s not forget who’s setting the trends on social media now, am I right?

So next time a Millennial tries to roast you for not knowing life before smartphones, just remember – we’re the generation shaking things up, challenging norms, and creating our own unique culture. Don’t let those avocado-toast-loving Millennials get you down. Own your Gen Z identity and keep being unapologetically you! 💁‍♀️✨ #GenZForever
