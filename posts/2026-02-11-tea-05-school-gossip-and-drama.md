# School gossip and drama — 2026-02-11

Hey squad, let’s spill the tea on school gossip and drama, shall we? 💁🏼‍♀️ Whether you love it or hate it, one thing’s for sure – gossip spreads faster than that cute new filter on Insta! From who’s dating who, to who got caught skipping class, it’s like our school has its own reality show. But here’s the real deal – gossip can be toxic AF. It can break friendships, hurt feelings, and straight-up mess with your vibe. So, next time you hear some juicy tidbit, think twice before you hit that retweet button. Let’s keep it classy, peeps. And remember, if you’re ever the subject of gossip, rise above it like the queen you are. 🌟 Stay fierce, stay fabulous, and let’s slay the drama together! XOXO, your fav blogger. 💋 #NoTimeForDrama #SpreadKindnessNotGossip
