# VSCO Girl — 2025-12-08

Hey, fellow Birkenstock-loving, scrunchie-wearing, Hydro Flask-toting VSCO Girls! 🌿📸💧 Let’s talk about the latest craze taking over our Instagram feeds – the VSCO Girl aesthetic. From oversized T-shirts and shell necklaces to saying “sksksk” and “and I oop,” we’re all about that laid-back, eco-friendly vibe. Forget about being picture-perfect, it’s all about embracing your natural beauty and saving the turtles, am I right? 🐢💕 And let’s not forget about those trusty metal straws and reusable shopping bags – we’re all about that sustainability! So next time you’re sipping on your matcha latte and listening to Billie Eilish, remember to stay true to your VSCO roots and spread those positive vibes. Keep being unapologetically you, VSCO Girls! 🌈✨ #LiveLaughLove #SaveTheTurtles #VSCOgirl
