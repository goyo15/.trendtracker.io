# VSCO Girl - Defined by a laid-back, beachy style featuring oversized t-shirts, scrunchies, Hydro Flasks, and Birkenstock sandals. — 2026-02-20

Hey, VSCO girls, you know who you are! Rocking that carefree, beachy vibe like it’s nobody’s business. Oversized tees, scrunchies for days, a Hydro Flask practically glued to your hand, and those classic Birkenstocks completing the look – you’ve got it all down to a science. 

But let’s not forget the essential VSCO girl attitude – eco-conscious, into saving the turtles, and spreading those positive vibes everywhere you go. You’re not just a style icon, you’re a whole vibe. 

Seriously, who needs designer brands when you’ve got a Hydro Flask filled with iced coffee and a scrunchie to match every outfit? Keep doing your thing, VSCO girls. Own your laid-back style, slay those beachy waves, and remember – save the turtles, always. 

Stay vibing, stay true to you. #VSCOgirlforlife 🐢🌊✌️
