# Preppy Style - Classic and polished, including button-down shirts, cardigans, and plaid skirts. — 2025-11-25

Hey, fashionistas! Let's talk preppy style, the OG of classic and polished looks. We're talking button-down shirts, cardigans, and plaid skirts that scream sophistication with a side of sass. 

Whether you're channeling Blair Waldorf vibes or going for that Gossip Girl meets Clueless aesthetic, preppy style is all about looking put-together while still keeping it fun and fresh. Pair a crisp white button-down with a plaid skirt for that schoolgirl chic look, or throw on a cozy cardigan over a pastel dress for a touch of sweetness.

It's all about mixing timeless pieces with a modern twist - think loafers with glitter socks or a statement belt with those pleated pants. So, grab your pearls, pop that collar, and own your preppy style like the trendsetter you are! Stay preppy, stay fabulous! 💁🏼‍♀️🌟✨ #PreppyVibes #SlayingInPlaid
