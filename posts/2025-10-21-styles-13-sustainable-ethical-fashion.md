# Sustainable/ethical fashion — 2025-10-21

Hey fam! Let’s chat about sustainable/ethical fashion, 'cause being on-trend doesn't have to mean wrecking the planet or exploiting sweatshop workers, am I right? 🌍💁‍♀️

These days, there are so many dope brands out there that are all about eco-friendly fabrics, fair wages, and transparent supply chains. And bonus - their clothes are fire 🔥! Sustainable fashion isn't just a trend, it's a movement towards a better future for our planet and the people on it.

So next time you're eyeing that cute top or killer pair of kicks, do a quick check – where were they made? What materials were used? Supporting ethical fashion means slayin' your look with a clean conscience. Let's show the world that we care about our style AND our impact. It’s time to make sustainable fashion the new cool. Stay woke, stay fabulous! 💅✨ #SustainableSlay #EthicalQueen
