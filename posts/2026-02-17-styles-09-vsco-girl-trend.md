# VSCO Girl Trend — 2026-02-17

Hey, fam! Let’s spill the tea on the VSCO girl trend – are we here for it or nah? 🐢🌊

So, like, scrunchies, Hydro Flasks, and oversized t-shirts – can we say, #basicmuch? But, let’s be real, the whole "save the turtles" vibe and no-makeup makeup are kind of refreshing, tbh. And who doesn’t love a cute puka shell necklace? 🐚💕

But, like, let’s not forget the dark side of the VSCO girl movement – the capitalism and consumerism driving it. Like, are we really saving the planet by buying all this stuff? 🤔

So, all in all, the VSCO girl trend is a fun vibe but let’s not get too caught up in the materialistic side of it. Stay true to yourself, don’t break the bank on Hydro Flasks, and just keep doing you! 🌸✌️ #staywoke #vscoforlife
