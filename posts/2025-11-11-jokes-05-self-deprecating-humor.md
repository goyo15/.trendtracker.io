# Self-deprecating humor — 2025-11-11

Hey fam, let’s talk about self-deprecating humor. It’s like a double-edged sword, am I right? On one hand, it can be funny and relatable AF. Like, who doesn’t love poking fun at themselves? But on the other hand, constant self-roasting can be a slippery slope into low self-esteem territory. It’s all fun and games until you start believing your own jokes, ya feel me?

I get it, we live in a world where self-deprecation is practically a language we speak fluently. But let’s remember to give ourselves credit where it’s due. We’re all uniquely awesome in our own ways, so why not sprinkle a little self-love into our humor mix?

So go ahead, crack those self-deprecating jokes, but don’t forget to balance it out with some self-appreciation too. Because at the end of the day, you’re a queen/king, and that’s no joke. Keep slayin’, fam! #LoveYourself #JustTeenyThings 💁‍♀️🔥✨
