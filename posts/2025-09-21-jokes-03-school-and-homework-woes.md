# School and homework woes — 2025-09-21

Ugh, can we talk about the never-ending cycle of school and homework woes? I mean, it's like, we finally get a break from school only to drown in a sea of assignments the minute we set foot back in the classroom. And don't even get me started on group projects - is it too much to ask for my classmates to actually do their share of the work?

Plus, can we talk about teachers who assign a mountain of homework over the weekend like it's NBD? Um, hello, we have a life outside of school, believe it or not. And let's not forget about those surprise quizzes that pop up out of nowhere. Like seriously, can we catch a break?

But hey, we're all in this together, right? Let's power through the school and homework struggles, support each other, and make it to the coveted finish line called graduation. Stay strong, my fellow students - we got this! ✌️ #SchoolWoes #HomeworkStruggles
