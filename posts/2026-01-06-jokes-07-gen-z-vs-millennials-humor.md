# Gen Z vs. Millennials humor — 2026-01-06

Hey, fellow Gen Z-ers! Let’s talk about the epic battle of humor between us and the Millennials. 🤣 Gen Z’s humor is all about quick wit, memes, and self-deprecation. We love dark humor and aren’t afraid to laugh at ourselves. Millennials, on the other hand, gravitate towards nostalgia, puns, and more wholesome jokes. They still think “that’s what she said” is hilarious, bless their hearts. 😜 But hey, both generations bring something to the table! While Millennials may not get all our TikTok references, they paved the way for us with their iconic Vine videos. So, let’s unite through laughter, appreciate each other’s comedic styles, and keep the humor flowing across the generational divide. After all, a good meme knows no age! Stay snappy, my friends! #GenZhumor #MillennialLaughs 🌟✌️
