# Parental and sibling trolling quips — 2025-12-27

Hey Fam! Let’s talk about the ultimate troll game in every household - parental and sibling trolling quips. 🙄 We all know that our parents and siblings have a PhD in sarcasm and a black belt in teasing. From classic one-liners like “Did you fall from heaven? Because it looks like you landed on your face” to “Are you a parking ticket? Because you’ve got ‘fine’ written all over you”, the trolling game is strong in my family.

But let’s be real, as annoying as these jabs can be, it’s all in good fun (or at least that’s what I tell myself when I’m the target). It’s like a secret language that only our family understands. So next time your mom says “Do I look like a taxi driver to you? Call yourself an Uber”, just remember it’s all out of love...I think. 😂 What are some of your favorite parental and sibling trolling quips? Share them in the comments below! #TrollSquad #FamilyRoast
