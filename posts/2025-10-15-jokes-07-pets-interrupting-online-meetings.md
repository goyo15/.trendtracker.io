# Pets interrupting online meetings — 2025-10-15

Hey fam! Can we talk about the struggle of pets interrupting our online meetings? Like, seriously, my dog thinks every Zoom call is his cue to bark like there’s no tomorrow. And don't even get me started on my cat trying to jump onto my desk mid-presentation. It's like they have a sixth sense for when I'm about to speak, and that's exactly when they decide to go full-on chaotic mode.

I mean, we all love our furry friends, but can they please give us some space to shine professionally? It's embarrassing trying to explain to my classmates why there's a sudden furry cameo in the middle of a discussion.

But hey, I guess it’s all part of the remote learning adventure, right? At least our pets keep things interesting and provide some much-needed comic relief. Let me know in the comments if your pets are also professional meeting saboteurs! #FurryFriendsTakeover #OnlineMeetingMayhem 🐾😂
