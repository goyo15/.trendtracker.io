# Types of people in online classes or group chats — 2025-09-27

Hey there fellow teens, let’s dive into the wild world of online classes and group chats. First up, we have the Overachiever – always first to turn in assignments, ask extra questions, and basically make the rest of us feel like we’re failing at life. Next, we’ve got the Ghost – never responds, never shows up, you start to wonder if they even exist in real life. Then there’s the Chatterbox – constantly commenting, asking off-topic questions, and basically turning the chat into their own personal party. And let’s not forget the Procrastinator – always sliding in last minute with excuses and asking for extensions. Lastly, we have the Meme Lord – turning every discussion into a meme fest, because who needs serious conversations anyway? What type are you in online classes or group chats? Let me know in the comments! Peace out, catch ya later!
