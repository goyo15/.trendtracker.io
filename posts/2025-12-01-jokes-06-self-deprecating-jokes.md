# Self-deprecating jokes — 2025-12-01

Hey squad, let’s talk about self-deprecating jokes – you know, those comments we make about ourselves that are supposed to be funny but often leave us feeling kinda crummy afterwards. 🤷‍♀️ Sure, laughing at ourselves can be a way to cope with insecurities, but constantly putting ourselves down isn’t a cute look.

Here’s the tea: self-love is the new flex, babes! Instead of making jokes at our own expense, let’s hype ourselves up and spread those good vibes. Your worth is not a punchline, and you deserve all the positivity in the world.

So, next time you catch yourself about to crack a self-deprecating joke, pause and think – is this really how I want to talk about myself? Let’s leave the self-roasts behind and start serving up some self-love real quick. You’re all queens and kings, own that crown! 👑💖 #PositivityOnly
