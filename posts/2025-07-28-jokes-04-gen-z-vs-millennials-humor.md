# Gen Z vs. Millennials humor — 2025-07-28

Alright, fam, let’s talk about the debate of the century: Gen Z humor vs. Millennials humor. Gen Z be like *insert obscure meme reference here* and Millennials be like *insert nostalgic throwback joke*. 💁‍♂️💁‍♀️ Are we really that different or just two sides of the same Gen Z-Millennial coin? 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️

Millennials love their avocado toast and side parts, while Gen Z can’t get enough of TikTok dances and VSCO filters. Both bring the jokes, but in their own unique way. Gen Z memes are faster than the speed of light, while Millennial humor is like a fine wine – aged to perfection. 🍷🕰️ Let’s face it, we all have our moments of peak comedy gold.

So, whether you’re a Gen Z’er or a Millennial, let’s laugh together and appreciate the diversity of humor across generations. After all, laughter knows no age limits. 😂💫 #HumorUnites #GenZvsMillennials
