# Relationships and dating — 2025-12-03

Alright, my fellow teens, let’s talk about relationships and dating. Listen up, because I’ve got some real talk for you. First off, let’s remember that you are worth more than someone who doesn’t appreciate you. Don’t settle for less, honey! Respect is key in any relationship, and if someone is treating you like dirt, kick ‘em to the curb. Also, communication is the name of the game. If you’re having issues, talk it out – no one can read minds (unless you’re a psychic, in which case, lucky you). And hey, don’t rush into anything just because everyone else is doing it. Take your time and make sure you’re ready. Lastly, enjoy the journey of dating. It’s not all about finding “the one” – sometimes it’s just about having fun and getting to know yourself better. Stay fierce, stay fabulous, and remember: you slay, no matter what. Peace out, babes!
