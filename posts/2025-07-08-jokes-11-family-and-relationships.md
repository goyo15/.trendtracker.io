# Family and Relationships — 2025-07-08

Hey there, fam! Let’s dive into the crazy world of family and relationships. Whether you're a total #mommasboy or always rollin' with your fave cousin squad, family is where it's at. They’re the OG squad that’s always got your back, despite the constant eye-rolls and arguments over who stole the last slice of pizza.

Speaking of relationships, let’s not forget about the potential bae or bestie drama. Sometimes it’s all heart emojis and late-night texts, other times it’s like, “Can you not right now?” But hey, that’s just part of the rollercoaster ride of teenage life.

So, whether you're having a deep heart-to-heart with your sis or giving your brother major side-eye, remember that family and relationships are what make life interesting. Embrace the chaos, keep it real, and never forget to show some love to those who drive you absolutely bonkers. Stay fab, fam! #squadgoals
