# Sleep and morning routine jokes — 2025-12-13

Hey, my fellow night owls and early birds! Let’s talk about sleep and morning routines – the struggle is real, am I right? Waking up for school while still half asleep, trying to navigate the AM fog like a zombie? Been there, done that. And don’t even get me started on hitting the snooze button a million times before finally dragging ourselves out of bed. 

But hey, at least we can find some humor in the chaos! Like when we try to put on our hoodie like pants or walk into a wall because we are still half asleep. Or maybe you’ve tried brushing your teeth with face wash instead of toothpaste – oops! 

So, let’s embrace the madness of mornings and share our best sleep and morning routine jokes. Because sometimes, all we can do is laugh at ourselves and our early-morning shenanigans. Stay groggy, my friends! ✌️😴 #MorningRoutineFail #SleepyStruggles
