# Drama within friend groups or schools — 2025-09-16

Hey, Drama Llamas! Let's talk about the never-ending soap opera that is drama within friend groups or schools. It's like a reality TV show that you didn't sign up for, am I right?

One minute you're BFFs with someone, and the next they're spreading rumors faster than you can say "fake news." Seriously, can we hit pause on the gossip train for like, five minutes? It's exhausting trying to keep up with who's friends with who and who's dating who.

And don't even get me started on group chats. One minute it's all fun and memes, and the next it's a battlefield of passive-aggressive comments and shade-throwing emojis. Can we all just take a chill pill and remember that kindness is cooler than being a mean girl or bro?

So, here's the tea: Drama is unavoidable, but how we handle it is what really matters. Let's try spreading positivity and support instead of stirring the pot, shall we? Stay drama-free, my fellow Drama Llamas! ✌️ #NoMoreDrama #StayCool
