# Self-deprecating humor — 2025-11-27

Hey, fam! Let's talk about self-deprecating humor - the ultimate coping mechanism or a slippery slope of low self-esteem? 🤷‍♀️ We've all LOL'd at self-roasts to lighten the mood, but when does it cross the line from funny to worrisome?

Sure, poking fun at yourself can be a way to connect with peeps and show you're down-to-earth. 🤪 But if you find yourself constantly dissing your own vibes, it's time to hit pause and check your self-love playlist. Remember, you're a fab mixtape of awesome tracks, not a CD full of skip-worthy bops.

So, play it cool with self-deprecating humor, but keep your self-worth on repeat. Know when to drop the mic on the self-roasts and turn up the volume on self-affirmation. 🎤💖 Stay woke, stay woke! Peace out, squad! #LoveYourself #NoRoastsJustToast 🍞🔥
