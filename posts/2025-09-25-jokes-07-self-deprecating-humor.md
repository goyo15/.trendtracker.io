# Self-Deprecating Humor â€” 2025-09-25

Hey there, fellow teens! Let's talk about self-deprecating humor â€“ you know, when you make jokes about yourself to get a laugh out of others. It's like poking fun at your own insecurities and flaws, all in good fun. 

But let's not go overboard with it, okay? Sure, we all have our moments of awkwardness and self-doubt, but constantly putting ourselves down can start being a bummer. Remember, self-love is key! 

So, use self-deprecating humor sparingly and make sure it doesn't turn into a habit that chips away at your self-esteem. It's all about balance, my friends. Embrace your quirks and imperfections, but also show yourself some love and kindness. 

Keep laughing, stay confident, and rock on with your awesome self! ðŸŒŸ #selflove #staythepositivecourse
