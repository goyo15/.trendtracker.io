# Self-deprecating humor — 2025-12-02

Hey, fam! Let’s talk about self-deprecating humor – you know, that kinda thing where you roast yourself before others can. 🤪 Sure, it can be funny AF at times, but listen up: too much of it is NOT a vibe. 

I get it, we all have those days when we feel like we’re failing at life, but constantly putting yourself down just ain’t it. Trust me, you’re way more lit than you give yourself credit for! Own your flaws, sure, but don’t let them define you.

It’s cool to laugh at yourself sometimes, but remember – you’re a boss in your own right! So, next time you wanna crack a self-deprecating joke, make sure it’s all in good fun and not coming from a place of self-doubt. Keep slayin’, my peeps! 💁🏽‍♀️✨ #selflove #confidenceboost #ownit
