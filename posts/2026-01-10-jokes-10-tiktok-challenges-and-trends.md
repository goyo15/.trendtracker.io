# TikTok challenges and trends — 2026-01-10

Hey there, trendsetters! Let’s talk TikTok challenges and trends—because who doesn’t love a viral craze, am I right? From the "Renegade" dance to the "Savage" challenge, there’s always something new blowing up our feeds.

But let’s keep it real, not every trend is a winner. Remember the Tide Pod challenge? Yeah, let’s leave that in 2019, please and thank you. It’s all fun and games until someone ends up in the ER, am I right?

So, what’s the next big thing on the horizon? Who knows, but one thing's for sure: TikTok is always evolving, and we’re here for it. Just remember to stay safe, stay smart, and maybe think twice before attempting that risky challenge your fave influencer just posted. Let’s keep the vibes positive and the trends hopping. Until next time, stay snazzy, my friends! #TikTokTrends #StaySafeStaySassy
