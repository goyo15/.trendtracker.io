# Science and technology jokes — 2026-02-10

Hey, fellow earthlings! 🌍 Let's talk about science and technology jokes that are so epic they should come with a caution sign for potential stomach cramps from laughing too hard. From coding mishaps to chemistry puns, these jokes are the nerdy equivalent of a mic drop. 

Why did the computer go to therapy? It had too many bytes of emotional baggage! 😂 Or how about this one: Why did the physics teacher break up with the biology teacher? There was no chemistry! 🔬 

Science and tech jokes are like a perfectly executed experiment - they either leave you laughing uncontrollably or scratching your head in confusion. So, grab your lab goggles and prepare for some serious laughs, because these jokes are definitely next-level nerdy. And remember, it's not rocket science... well, actually, sometimes it is. 🚀 #NerdHumorForTheWin #ScienceTechJokesForDays
