# Fashion trends and fashion faux pas — 2025-09-26

Hey fam! Let’s talk about fashion trends and the fashion faux pas that make us cringe, am I right? 😅

First up, if you’re still rocking those low-rise jeans from the 2000s, it’s time to let them go. High-waisted jeans are where it’s at now and they are way more flattering, trust me.

Also, can we please leave Crocs in the past where they belong? I don’t care how comfy they are, they are a big fashion no-no in my book. Opt for some trendy sneakers or sandals instead.

On the flip side, oversized blazers and chunky sneakers are totally in right now and I am HERE for it. And don’t even get me started on the power of accessorizing with statement earrings or a cute belt.

So, take some risks, embrace the trends, but also know when to say no to those cringe-worthy fashion faux pas. Stay stylish, fam! 💁‍♀️💅 #FashionForward #NoMoreCrocs
