# Sleep and procrastination humor — 2025-12-22

Hey there squad, let’s talk about the ultimate struggle every teen faces - sleep and procrastination! 🛌😴 We all know the classic scenario of saying, "just one more episode" at 10 PM and suddenly it's 2 AM and you still haven't started that essay due tomorrow.📚 And don't even get me started on hitting snooze on our alarms... five times.⏰ Procrastination seems to have a vendetta against our sleep schedule, am I right? But hey, at least we can all bond over our collective lack of time management skills! 😂 Who needs a full 8 hours of sleep anyway when you can binge-watch TikToks until the sun comes up?! In conclusion, we may be yawning all day, but at least we can laugh about it together. Stay sleepy, stay sassy! 💤✨ #ProcrastinationNation #SleepyButSassy
