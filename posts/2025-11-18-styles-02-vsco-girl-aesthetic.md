# VSCO girl aesthetic — 2025-11-18

Hey y'all, let’s talk about the VSCO girl aesthetic that’s taking over our feeds! From oversized t-shirts to scrunchies to Hydro Flasks, this trend is all about carefree vibes and environmental vibes. 

But let's be real, being a VSCO girl goes beyond just the stuff you show off in your pics. It's all about a mindset too - caring about the planet, spreading positivity, and soaking up all those beachy moments.

Sure, some may say it’s just a trend, but hey, there’s nothing wrong with rocking a scrunchie and saving the sea turtles at the same time, am I right?

So grab your reusable straw, slip on those Birkenstocks, and embrace your inner VSCO girl. Don’t forget to finish off your look with that classic peace sign pose and filter your pics with a touch of that VSCO app magic. Stay salty, stay sustainable, and keep the good vibes rolling! ✌🏼🌊 #VSCOgirl #SaveTheTurtles
