# Parenting fails and quirks — 2026-02-13

Hey, fellow teenagers! Let’s talk about some of our parents’ hilarious fails and quirky habits. 

First up, the classic Dad joke fails. Eye-rolling is our default reaction to those cringeworthy one-liners, but hey, at least they’re trying, right? 

Let’s not forget about Mom’s obsession with embarrassing us in front of our friends. Whether it’s showing baby pictures or trying to be the “cool mom”, she always leaves us cringing.

But hey, we love them for all their quirks and fails. At the end of the day, they’re just trying their best to navigate this parenting thing. So here’s to our wonderful, embarrassing, and always entertaining parents!
