# Social media and influencer humor — 2026-01-21

Hey fam! Let’s talk about social media and influencer humor today. 📱💁‍♀️

We all know that influencers have the power to make us LOL with their witty posts and relatable content, but let’s not forget the darker side of influencer humor. Sometimes, their jokes can be problematic or insensitive, causing harm instead of spreading joy. As teens navigating this digital landscape, it’s important for us to be critical consumers of the content we consume.

So, next time you come across a post that doesn’t sit right with you, don’t be afraid to speak up and call it out. It’s cool to have a laugh, but not at the expense of others. Let’s use our voices to amplify positive, inclusive humor that brings us together, rather than tearing us apart.

Stay woke, stay funny, and remember: you have the power to shape the social media world you want to see. 💪✨ #InfluencerHumor #ChooseKindness
