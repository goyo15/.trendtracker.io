# VSCO girl style — 2025-09-10

Hey, fellow teens! Let's talk about VSCO girl style – the ultimate laid-back, beachy vibe that's taking over the internet. Think oversized tie-dye shirts, high-waisted shorts, and Birkenstocks for days. The key accessories? Scrunchies, Hydro Flasks, and don't forget your reusable metal straw!

Embracing the VSCO girl aesthetic is all about staying eco-conscious and effortlessly cool. You'll catch us saying "sksksk" and "and I oop" while spreading good vibes and positive energy. It's all about living in the moment, capturing our adventures on our trusty disposable cameras, and editing our pics with those signature VSCO filters.

So, if you're all about saving the turtles, rocking that beachy glow, and channeling those chill vibes, then hop on the VSCO girl train. Just remember, it's not just a style – it's a lifestyle. Stay trendy, stay woke, and stay VSCO, my friends! #SaveTheTurtles🐢💚✌️
