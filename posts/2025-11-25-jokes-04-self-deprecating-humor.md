# Self-deprecating humor — 2025-11-25

Hey there, fellow teens! Let's talk about self-deprecating humor - you know, that thing we all do when we make fun of ourselves to get a laugh. It's like our go-to move when we're feeling a bit meh about ourselves. But here's the tea - while a little self-deprecation can be funny, too much of it can be a major buzzkill. 

It's cool to poke fun at ourselves every now and then, but constantly putting ourselves down ain't it, sis! We're all amazing in our own ways, and we deserve to give ourselves some credit. So, next time you wanna crack a self-deprecating joke, remember to balance it out with some self-love vibes. 

Let's keep the humor real, but also remember that we're all slaying in our own unique styles. Stay sassy, stay fabulous, and remember - you're the main character of your own epic story! 💁‍♀️✨ #SelfLoveSunday #OwnYourAwesomeness
