# A popular student is facing backlash for problematic comments made online. â€” 2025-09-13

Hey, fam! Who knew that the so-called "popular kids" weren't all they're cracked up to be? The internet is blowing up right now with some serious drama as one of our school's big shots is getting major backlash for their problematic online comments. 

Seriously, how many times do we have to say it? Words matter, people! It doesn't matter how many followers you have or how many parties you get invited to - if you're spreading hate or ignorance online, you're going down. And this student is learning that the hard way.

It just goes to show that no one is immune to the consequences of their words. So let's use this as a reminder to think before we type, and to always be kind and inclusive online. We've got the power to make the internet a better place, so let's use it! Stay woke, y'all. #OnlineResponsibility #SpreadKindness
