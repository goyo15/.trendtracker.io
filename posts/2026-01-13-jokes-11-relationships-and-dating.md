# Relationships and Dating — 2026-01-13

Hey fam, let’s spill the tea on relationships and dating. Firstly, if your crush is giving you mixed signals, it’s time to decode that. Don’t waste your time on someone who can’t make up their mind - queen, you deserve clarity and respect. And let’s talk about communication, the bread and butter of any relationship. Texting can be fun, sure, but face-to-face convos? Chef's kiss. It’s all about vulnerability and keeping it real. Don’t be afraid to show your true self, flaws and all. Lastly, don’t forget the golden rule: self-love is non-negotiable. Before swiping right on someone else, swipe right on yourself. Know your worth, and don’t settle for anyone who doesn’t see it. Keep slaying, stay strong, and most importantly, stay true to you. Love y’all. #relationshipgoals #selflove
