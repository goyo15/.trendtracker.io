Hey hey, my fellow cool teens! Let's talk about virtual prom disasters and those hilarious promposal stories that are making the rounds. So, who knew that Zoom proms could be so chaotic? From WiFi issues to awkward dances in our living rooms, it's been a wild ride. But hey, at least we can attend in our pajamas, am I right?

And let's not forget about the promposals that make us cringe and laugh at the same time. Like that guy who dressed up as a giant chicken to ask his crush to prom – now that's commitment! Or the girl who wrote "Prom?" in giant letters on her roof just to get a "no" in response. Ouch!

Whether your virtual prom was a disaster or your promposal was a total fail, just remember to keep it real and have a good laugh. After all, these are the moments we'll look back on and crack up about when we're old and boring. Stay sassy, my friends!
