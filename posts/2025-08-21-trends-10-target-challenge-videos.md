Hey, squad! Have you guys been seeing all those Target challenge videos blowing up on TikTok and YouTube lately? I mean, who knew that shopping at Target could be so intense and hilarious at the same time, am I right?

So, grab your BFFs, head to your nearest Target, and see if youâ€™ve got what it takes to conquer the latest challenge. Just remember to keep it fun, stay low-key, and make sure to check out in the self-checkout line for maximum sneakiness.
