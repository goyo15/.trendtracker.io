# Cooking/Baking Tutorials - Gen Z has shown a keen interest in cooking and baking tutorials, especially during the pandemic. — 2026-02-04

Hey there, foodie fam! Can we take a minute to appreciate the rise of cooking and baking tutorials among us Gen Z peeps? Quarantine turned us all into amateur chefs, whipping up Dalgona coffees and banana bread like pros.

I mean, who needs fancy culinary schools when you’ve got YouTube teaching you how to craft the perfect soufflé or TikTok showing you the ultimate pasta hacks? From aesthetically pleasing charcuterie boards to viral cloud bread recipes, our feeds have been flooded with all things delicious.

And let’s not forget the therapeutic aspect of spending hours in the kitchen, experimenting with flavors and creating edible art. It’s like a form of self-care that fills both our stomachs and souls.

So, here’s to all the kitchen warriors out there, blending, sautéing, and baking their way through these wild times. Keep stirring up those tasty creations and sharing the culinary love! 🍳🍰 #FoodieGenZ
