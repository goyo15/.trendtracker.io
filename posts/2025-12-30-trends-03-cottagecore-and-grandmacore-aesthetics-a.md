# "Cottagecore" and "Grandmacore" aesthetics and DIY projects — 2025-12-30

Hey fam! Let’s chat about the cozy and wholesome vibes of “Cottagecore” and “Grandmacore” aesthetics taking over our feeds. 🌿🌻

Cottagecore is all about embracing that simple, countryside life - think flowy dresses, floral patterns, and vintage treasures. It’s basically living in a fairytale cottage, minus the evil stepmother.

On the flip side, Grandmacore brings the old-school grandma vibes into our modern world. Think crochet blankets, teacup collections, and baking from scratch. It's all about paying homage to our grandmas' timeless style and skills.

Want to jump on these trends? Try some DIY projects like flower pressing, knitting a scarf, or creating a cozy reading nook in your room.

So, whether you vibe with the cottage life or prefer the grandma chic look, these aesthetics are all about finding comfort and joy in the little things. Embrace it, make it your own, and spread those cozy vibes! 💫✨ #Cottagecore #Grandmacore #DIYProjects #CozyVibes
