# Online learning and Zoom — 2025-08-28

Hey squad, let’s talk about the online learning experience through Zoom. Remember when we all thought online classes would be a breeze? Well, let me tell you, it’s been a rollercoaster ride! 

Sure, the convenience of attending class in pajamas is a vibe, but can we talk about those awkward silences and technical glitches? It’s like playing a never-ending game of ‘who can unmute themselves the quickest.’ And don’t even get me started on the WiFi drama – it’s like a bad breakup every time it decides to call it quits mid-lecture.

But hey, it’s not all bad. Virtual breakout rooms have become our go-to spot for sharing memes and gossiping without the teacher catching us. And let’s not forget the beauty of the mute button when you want to scoff down a snack during class.

So, here’s to navigating the wild world of online learning through Zoom – may our WiFi be strong and our attention spans even stronger! Stay sassy, stay savvy! ✌🏼 #ZoomStruggles #OnlineLearningWoes
