# Social media and influencers — 2025-10-28

Hey fam! Let’s spill the tea ☕️ on social media and influencers. We all know the deal - scrolling through Insta, we see influencers living their best life, rocking trendy outfits, and promoting products like there’s no tomorrow. But let’s keep it real, are they just living in a filtered dream world? 

Sure, influencers can be fun to follow and have some killer style inspo, but let’s not get sucked into the comparison game. Remember, what you see online is just a highlight reel, not the full picture. It’s important to stay grounded and not let social media dictate your self-worth. 

At the end of the day, use social media mindfully, follow accounts that uplift you, and remember that influencers are just regular people too. So, stay real, stay true to yourself, and remember that your worth isn’t based on likes or followers. Keep serving those positive vibes, my queens and kings! #StayAuthentic 💖✨
