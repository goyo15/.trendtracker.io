# Preppy and classic ensembles — 2025-07-30

Hey teens, let’s talk preppy and classic ensembles! Whether you’re a total Blair Waldorf fan or just looking to up your fashion game, preppy style is where it’s at. Think plaid skirts, crisp white button-downs, and a touch of pearls for that timeless look. Pair a cable knit sweater with some high-waisted trousers for a preppy vibe that screams sophistication.

And let’s not forget the classic ensembles - a little black dress never goes out of style! Channel your inner Audrey Hepburn with a chic trench coat or a structured blazer. Keep it classy with a tailored fit and simple accessories.

So, whether you’re heading to class or a fancy dinner, preppy and classic ensembles are sure to make you feel confident and stylish. Embrace the look, add your personal flair, and own it! Stay chic, babes! #PreppyAndProud 💁🏼‍♀️💕✨
