# Online challenges and viral trends — 2025-08-08

Hey, fam! Let’s talk online challenges and viral trends – the good, the bad, and the just plain crazy. Who else remembers the Ice Bucket Challenge? That was lit, raising awareness for ALS and bringing communities together.

But let’s not forget the cringe-worthy ones too, like the Tide Pod challenge. Seriously, people, eating detergent is so 2018. And don’t even get me started on the TikTok trends that come and go faster than you can say “viral”.

Here’s the tea: online challenges can be fun, but let’s stay woke and think before jumping on the bandwagon. Let’s use our influence for good, spread positivity, and uplift each other. And hey, if a challenge involves dance moves or a good cause, count me in!

Stay woke, stay safe, and keep slaying those challenges, fam. Catch you on the flip side! #ChallengeAccepted 💃🔥✌️
