# Food and snack preferences — 2025-09-21

Hey, foodies! Let’s dish about our ultimate snack preferences. Are you team sweet or team salty? Personally, I’m all about that perfect balance between the two. Give me some crispy sea-salted chips with a side of creamy chocolate and I’m one happy camper. 

But hey, let’s not forget about those must-have snack essentials. I’m talking about the classic combo of popcorn and M&Ms at the movies, or the unbeatable duo of pizza and soda during a Netflix binge. And let’s not overlook the OG snack queen – the mighty avocado toast. I mean, who doesn’t love a good avo smash, am I right?

So whether you’re craving something savory, sweet, or a little bit of both, remember that snacking is an art form. It’s all about finding that perfect mix of flavors and textures that make your taste buds sing. Stay snacking, my friends! ✌️🍿🍫🥑 #SnackAttack
