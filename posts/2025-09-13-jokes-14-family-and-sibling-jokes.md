You can roast each other one minute and have each otherâ€™s back the next. Itâ€™s all about that perfect balance of love and teasing. Sharing a laugh with your siblings strengthens the connection you have with them and creates memories that will last a lifetime. So, next time your sister steals your favorite hoodie or your brother eats the last slice of pizza, just remember that itâ€™s all part of the sibling code.
