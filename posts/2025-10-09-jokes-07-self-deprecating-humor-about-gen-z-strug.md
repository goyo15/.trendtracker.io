# Self-deprecating humor about Gen Z struggles — 2025-10-09

Hey fam, let’s talk about the OG Gen Z coping mechanism – self-deprecating humor. We’re all out here adulting like pros, but let’s be real, we’re still just kids trying to survive in a world full of student loans and internet trolls.

From TikTok fails to dating disasters, we’ve got a PhD in Gen Z struggles. We laugh at ourselves to keep from crying, am I right? Like, we can’t even handle a phone call without breaking into a cold sweat. And don’t get me started on trying to parallel park – I need GPS just to get into a parking spot.

So, shoutout to all my fellow Gen Z warriors out there. Keep slaying, keep meme-ing, and remember, it’s okay to laugh at your own chaos. Embrace the struggle, own your flaws, and remember, we’re all in this mess together. Stay sassy, stay self-deprecating, and keep shining, fam! ✌️💖 #GenZStruggles #MemeSquad
