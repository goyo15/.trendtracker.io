# Plant parenting and indoor gardening — 2026-02-16

Hey plant parents! 🌿 Indoor gardening is all the rage and I’m here to spill the dirt on how to become a pro at plant parenting. First things first, choose plants that match your vibe and space - succulents for the lazy (like me), or monsteras for the bold. Don’t forget about lighting! Most plants need some sun to thrive, so place them by a window or invest in a grow light. 

Maintaining your indoor garden is like a workout for your green thumb. Water your plants regularly, but not too much (they don’t like soggy feet). And show them some love by occasionally wiping their leaves and talking to them (yes, they thrive on attention). 

So hop on the plant parent bandwagon, add some green to your space, and watch your indoor jungle grow! Let’s turn our homes into urban oases, one leafy friend at a time. 🌱💚 #PlantParenting #IndoorGardening101
