# School and homework humor — 2026-01-01

Hey, fam! Let’s talk about that never-ending struggle we all know too well – school and homework. *insert eye roll here* 🙄 

I mean, c’mon, why do teachers think it’s funny to assign us a pile of homework on a Friday? Like, hello – weekends are for Netflix and chilling, not for solving math problems! And don’t even get me started on group projects. It’s like playing a game of “who can do the least amount of work” with your classmates. 

But hey, we gotta find the humor in all this chaos, right? Like when you accidentally turn in your rough draft instead of the final essay – oops! Or when your dog really does eat your homework (seriously, it happens). 

So, let’s keep laughing through the tears, my friends. School and homework may be a struggle, but at least we can meme our way through it. Stay sassy and stay strong, loves! 💁🏽‍♀️✨ #SchoolHumor #HomeworkSucks
