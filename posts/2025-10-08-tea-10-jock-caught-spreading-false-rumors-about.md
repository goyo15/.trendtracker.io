# Jock caught spreading false rumors about a fellow student, causing conflict in the school. — 2025-10-08

Hey, hey, hey, teens! Let’s talk about the drama going down at our school. So, get this - the star jock, Mr. Popular himself, got caught red-handed spreading fake news about a fellow student. Seriously, dude? Not cool!

It’s causing major chaos in the hallways, with people taking sides and tensions running high. And for what? Just to boost his own ego? News flash, buddy - spreading rumors doesn’t make you cool, it makes you a jerk.

We’re all about lifting each other up, not tearing each other down. So let’s use our voices for good and shut down this drama. Stand up for what’s right and show that we won’t stand for bullying, lies, or drama in our school.

Let’s be the generation that builds each other up, not tears each other down. Spread kindness, not rumors. It’s time to squash the drama and make our school a place where everyone feels safe and respected. Peace out, drama llamas! ✌️ #SpreadKindnessNotRumors
