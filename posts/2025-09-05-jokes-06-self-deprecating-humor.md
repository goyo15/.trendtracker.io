# Self-deprecating humor — 2025-09-05

Hey, fellow teens! Let's chat about that trend everyone's jumping on: self-deprecating humor. 🙃 Sure, we all like a good laugh at ourselves now and then, but when does it cross the line from light-hearted joke to major self-drag? 🤔 It's cool to be able to laugh at our quirks and mishaps, but constantly putting yourself down isn't a great look. Let's remember that we're awesome just the way we are, flaws and all! 🌟 So, next time you catch yourself about to make that self-deprecating joke, pause and think: does this really make me feel better about myself, or am I just trying to fit in with the crowd? Let's keep the humor light and fun, not a one-way ticket to Negative Town. Stay snappy, stay confident, and keep slaying, my friends! 💁‍♀️💪 #SelfLove #PositiveVibesOnly
