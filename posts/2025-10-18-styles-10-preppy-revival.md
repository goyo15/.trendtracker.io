# Preppy revival — 2025-10-18

Hey there, trendsetters! Can we talk about the preppy revival happening right now? From plaid skirts to cable knit sweaters, preppy style is making a major comeback and I am living for it. Think Cher Horowitz meets Blair Waldorf – classic pieces with a modern twist.

I'm all about the collared shirts, argyle patterns, and penny loafers being all the rage again. It's like embracing your inner bookworm chic vibes while still looking totally on-trend. And let's not forget the power of layering – vests, blazers, and statement accessories are key to nailing the preppy look.

So, if you're ready to elevate your style game and channel those Ivy League vibes, now's the time to jump on the preppy bandwagon. Mix up those prints, play with textures, and don't forget to top it off with a cute headband or silk scarf. Preppy never looked so cool! #preppyrevival #stylegoals
