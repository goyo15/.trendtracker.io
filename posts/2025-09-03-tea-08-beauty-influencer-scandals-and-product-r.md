# Beauty influencer scandals and product reviews — 2025-09-03

Hey fam, let’s spill the tea on beauty influencer scandals and product reviews! 🍵💄 We all know that our fave influencers can’t always be trusted with their recommendations, right? From fake reviews to shady sponsorships, it’s hard to know who’s keeping it real in the beauty world.

But don’t stress, I got your back! Before swiping that credit card for the latest must-have product, do a quick double-take on who’s promoting it. Look for influencers who #keepitreal and aren’t afraid to call out sketchy companies.

And when it comes to scandalous influencers, don’t be afraid to unfollow and unsubscribe. Your beauty game should be all about empowerment, not shady deals and drama.

So let’s stay woke and slay those beauty looks with products we can trust! 💋✨ #RealReviewsOnly #BeautyInfluencerDrama
