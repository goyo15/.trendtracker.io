# Mental health awareness and self-care routines — 2025-09-11

Hey there, fellow teens! Let’s talk mental health and self-care, because self-love is the best kind of love. 💆‍♀️ It’s cool to be open about our struggles and not be afraid to seek help when we need it. Remember, you’re not alone in this rollercoaster of emotions! 🎢

Self-care isn’t all face masks and bubble baths (although those are pretty awesome). It’s about setting boundaries, practicing mindfulness, and checking in with yourself regularly. ✨ Find what soothes your soul and make it a part of your routine, whether it’s journaling, listening to music, or going for a run.

Let’s break the stigma around mental health and make self-care a non-negotiable in our lives. It’s not selfish, it’s necessary. Remember, you are worthy of love and support, so let’s prioritize our well-being together. 💖 Stay strong, stay kind, and remember to be gentle with yourself. You’re doing amazing, sweetie! 💪🌟 #SelfCareSquad #MentalHealthMatters
