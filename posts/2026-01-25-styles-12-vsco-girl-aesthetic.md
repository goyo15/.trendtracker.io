# VSCO girl aesthetic — 2026-01-25

Hey fellow VSCO girls and guys! Let’s talk about the VSCO girl aesthetic - the ultimate cool-girl vibe that’s taking over social media. From scrunchies to Hydro Flasks, this trend is all about beachy vibes and environmental consciousness. 

Think oversized shirts, Birkenstocks, and loads of shell accessories. And of course, can’t forget about those iconic metal straws! VSCO girls are all about being chill, caring for the planet, and capturing insta-worthy moments with those classic yellow tinted photos.

But here’s the thing, it’s not just about the products - it’s about the mindset. Embracing positivity, spreading good vibes, and focusing on self-care. So whether you’re a VSCO girl in training or already living the aesthetic, remember to stay true to yourself and keep that good energy flowing. Stay cool, stay VSCO!✌️🌊🌿 #VSCOgirlaesthetic #PositiveVibesOnly
