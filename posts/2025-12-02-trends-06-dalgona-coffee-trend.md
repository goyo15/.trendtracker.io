# Dalgona Coffee Trend — 2025-12-02

Hey fam, have you heard about the latest TikTok craze taking over quarantine life? That’s right, I’m talking about Dalgona coffee! This frothy, creamy drink is blowing up my feed and I had to see what all the hype was about. 

After whipping up some instant coffee, sugar, and hot water into a fluffy cloud of deliciousness, I poured it over some milk and was legit shook at how good it tasted. We’re talking café-worthy vibes right in my own kitchen, people! 

I’m officially joining the Dalgona crew and I’m not looking back. It’s like a mini coffee shop experience without having to change out of my pajamas. So if you haven’t tried it yet, what are you waiting for? Get on that Dalgona train and let’s all become barista pros together! #DalgonaCoffee #TikTokTrend #QuarantineLife
