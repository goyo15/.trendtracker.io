# Online bullying incidents — 2025-10-09

Hey fam, let’s talk about online bullying for a sec. I know, it’s so 2008, but sadly, it’s still a major issue. Cyberbullying can seriously mess with someone’s mental health and self-esteem. The keyboard warriors hiding behind their screens think they’re tough stuff, but they’re just spreading negativity and hurting others.

Remember, behind every screen is a real person with real feelings. We need to stand up against this toxic behavior and support each other online. If you see someone being bullied, don’t just scroll past – speak up, report it, be a decent human being. And if you’re the one being targeted, never suffer in silence. Reach out to someone you trust and don’t let the haters bring you down.

Let’s make the internet a safe space for everyone. Spread love, not hate. #StopCyberbullying #KindnessMatters 💻✌️
