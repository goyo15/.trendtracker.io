# Social media and internet culture (memes, TikTok, influencers) — 2025-07-25

Hey there, fellow cool cats and internet addicts! Let’s dive into the wild world of social media and internet culture – it’s like a digital jungle out there, am I right?

From viral memes that crack us up to TikTok dances that we all try (and probably fail) to perfect, the internet has completely changed the way we connect and communicate. We’re living in the age of influencers, where just one Instagram post can make someone famous overnight. It’s like every social media platform is its own little universe, with its own rules and trends.

But hey, let’s not forget to stay woke and critical of what we consume online. Not everything we see is real or healthy, and it’s important to take breaks from the constant scroll-scroll-scrolling. Let’s use our internet-savvy skills to uplift, inspire, and spread positivity in this crazy online world. Stay rad, stay safe, and keep those memes coming! Peace out ✌️ #InternetCulture #StayWoke
