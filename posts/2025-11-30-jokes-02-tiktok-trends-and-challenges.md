# TikTok trends and challenges — 2025-11-30

Hey fellow Gen Zers, let’s talk about TikTok trends and challenges, shall we? 🤳🔥 From dance crazes to viral challenges, this app has got it all. But let’s be real, some of these trends are straight-up ridiculous! 🙄 Like, who came up with "Throwback Challenge" where you pretend you’re in an old photo? And don’t even get me started on the "Fruit Snack Challenge" - why are we wasting perfectly good snacks for a TikTok video?! 🍇🍬

But hey, I’m not here to hate on all the trends. Some challenges are actually pretty fun and creative. Who doesn’t love a good dance challenge that makes you want to get up and bust a move? 💃 Or the random “DIY hacks” that either work like magic or fail miserably? 😂

So, love ‘em or hate ‘em, TikTok trends and challenges are here to stay. Just remember to stay safe and use your common sense before jumping on the trend wagon. Happy scrolling, my friends! 😎✌️ #TikTokTrendsetter
