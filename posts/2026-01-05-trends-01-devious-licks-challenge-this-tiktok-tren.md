# "Devious Licks" Challenge - This TikTok trend involves students vandalizing school property and stealing items, leading to widespread controversy and backlash. — 2026-01-05

Hey, fam! Let’s chat about the latest craze sweeping TikTok - the “Devious Licks” challenge. I mean, seriously? Vandalizing school property and stealing stuff just for clout? That’s a hard pass from me.

I get it, we’re all trying to navigate this crazy world of social media, but there’s a line, guys. It’s one thing to have a little fun, but let’s not forget the consequences. Not only is it totally uncool to mess with school property, but it’s also illegal. And let’s not even get started on the impact it has on our schools and communities.

So, let’s use our influence for good, not for destruction. Let’s be the change we want to see in the world, not the reason for more controversy and backlash. Stay smart, stay kind, and let’s leave the “Devious Licks” challenge in the rearview mirror where it belongs. Peace out! #PositiveVibesOnly
