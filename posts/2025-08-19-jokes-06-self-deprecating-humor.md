# Self-deprecating humor — 2025-08-19

Hey there, fellow teens! Let’s talk about self-deprecating humor – you know, making jokes at our own expense. While it can be a fun way to cope with insecurities and relate to others, we gotta be careful not to take it too far! 

Sure, I love poking fun at my tendency to trip over my own feet or my questionable dance moves, but constantly putting ourselves down isn’t cool. We’re awesome in our own unique ways, and we shouldn’t let self-deprecating humor overshadow our self-confidence.

So, let’s use self-deprecating humor in moderation, and remember to balance it out with self-love and appreciation. Embrace your quirks, laugh at yourself, but always remember that you’re totally rad just the way you are. Keep shining, my friends! ✌️ #LoveYourself #LaughWithKindness
