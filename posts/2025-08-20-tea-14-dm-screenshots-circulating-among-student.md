# DM screenshots circulating among students revealing gossip or secrets — 2025-08-20

Hey, fam! Let’s talk about the shady screenshots making the rounds at school. 🔥 You know the ones I’m talking about – DMs revealing all the gossip and secrets we thought were locked up tight. It’s like a virtual game of telephone, except the whole school is listening in. 💬

But before you hit that share button, pause for a sec. Spreading someone else’s private messages isn’t just uncool, it’s a major violation of trust. 🚫 Let’s keep it real – we all have stuff we wouldn’t want broadcasted to the world. So, let’s treat others how we want to be treated. #GoldenRule

Instead of feeding the drama llama, let’s lift each other up and create a positive vibe. Spread some love, not screenshots. 🌟 Remember, real friends don’t screenshot and tell. Stay classy, stay sassy! 💁‍♀️💅 #NoScreenshotsAllowed
