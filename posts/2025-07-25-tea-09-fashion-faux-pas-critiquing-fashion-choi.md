# Fashion faux pas: Critiquing fashion choices and outfits of peers or celebrities is a common subject of gossip among teens. — 2025-07-25

Hey babes, let’s talk about something that’s all too common in our world of selfies and social media – critiquing fashion choices. 🙅‍♀️ It’s like every day we see articles and gossip about what so-and-so wore to the party or how someone’s outfit was sooo last season. But here’s the tea – fashion is all about expressing yourself, so who are we to judge? Maybe someone’s quirky style is their way of shining bright like a diamond! 💎 Let’s focus on uplifting each other and celebrating our unique tastes rather than tearing each other down over a pair of sneakers or a crop top, okay? Remember, no one has the authority to dictate what’s hot or not. So shine on, slay queens, and let’s spread some positivity instead of shade. Stay stylish, stay sassy! 💋 #FashionPositivity #NoMoreFashionFauxPas
