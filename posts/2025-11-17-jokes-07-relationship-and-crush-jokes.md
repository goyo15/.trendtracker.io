# Relationship and crush jokes — 2025-11-17

Hey there, fellow teens! Let’s talk about relationship and crush jokes - the good, the bad, and the cringey!

First things first, a well-timed joke about crushes and relationships can be the perfect icebreaker with your crew. Whether it’s poking fun at your own awkward flirting skills or teasing a friend about their crush, a little humor can definitely lighten the mood.

But, here’s the deal- let’s keep it respectful and inclusive. Jokes should never make someone feel embarrassed or uncomfortable, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. And remember, not everyone is on the same page when it comes to humor, so always be mindful of your audience.

So, go ahead, share a funny meme or crack a witty joke about that crush of yours, but let’s make sure it’s all in good fun and leaves everyone laughing (not cringing) together! #RelationshipJokes #CrushHumor
