# Sports and athletics - Lighthearted jokes about sports teams, athletes, and sporting events. — 2025-09-19

Hey readers! Let’s kick things off with some lighthearted jokes about sports that will have you rolling on the floor laughing - not from a bad tackle, hopefully.

1. Why did the football coach go to the bank? To get his quarterback! 🏈
2. Did you hear about the basketball player who became a magician? He could make three-pointers disappear! 🏀
3. Why did the golfer bring two pairs of pants? In case he got a hole-in-one! ⛳
4. How does a soccer player stay cool during the game? They stand near the fans! ⚽
5. Why did the track coach carry a ladder? He heard the runners needed to get a little higher! 🏃‍♂️

Hope these jokes scored a laugh or two. Remember, sports are meant to be fun, on and off the field! Stay sharp, stay snappy, and keep that sporting spirit alive! #LaughingAllTheWayToTheEndzone
