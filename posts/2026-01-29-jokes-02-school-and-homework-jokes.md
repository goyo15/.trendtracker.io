# School and homework jokes — 2026-01-29

Hey fellow teens! Let’s talk about school and homework jokes – because let’s face it, sometimes laughter is the best way to survive those long study sessions and boring lectures. 

Like, why did the math book look sad? Because it had too many problems. 📚 Or how about the classic excuse: “My dog ate my homework”? Yeah, right! 🐶 And let’s not forget that feeling when you finally finish a big project and realize you left it at home. Oops! 😅

But hey, whether it’s sharing funny memes with your classmates or coming up with creative ways to procrastinate, humor is always a good way to make school a little less stressful. Just remember, laughter is the best medicine – even when you’re drowning in assignments. So keep cracking those jokes and remember, we’re all in this homework struggle together! Stay funny, stay cool. ✌️ #SchoolJokes #HomeworkHumor
