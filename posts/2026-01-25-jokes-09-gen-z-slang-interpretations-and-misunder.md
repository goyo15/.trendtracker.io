# Gen Z slang interpretations and misunderstandings — 2026-01-25

Hey fam, let’s talk about some classic Gen Z slang interpretations and misunderstandings that are low-key hilarious. First off, let’s set the record straight - “lit” doesn’t mean you’re on fire, it just means something is super cool or exciting. And don’t get it twisted, “slay” isn’t about killing someone, it’s just about looking fierce and doing your thing like a boss. 

But let’s not front, sometimes even we get our own slang twisted. Ever said “I’m dead” when something’s so funny you can’t handle it? Yeah, we’re not actually deceased, it’s just our way of saying something’s hilarious. And don’t even get me started on “sksksk” and “and I oop” - they’re like the secret code words of stan Twitter that even we struggle to explain. 

So next time you hear a Gen Z-er dropping some slang, just remember, it’s all about that lit vibe and keeping it 💯. Stay woke, fam. Peace out.
