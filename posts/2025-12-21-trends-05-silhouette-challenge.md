# Silhouette challenge — 2025-12-21

Hey squad, have you seen the latest TikTok trend lighting up our feeds? The silhouette challenge is taking over with its sultry vibes and killer confidence! It's all about strutting your stuff in a doorway, then turning into a shadowy silhouette against a bright red background. Talk about major drama!

But hold up, let’s remember to keep it fun and safe. Some peeps are finding ways to remove the red filter and see more than intended, so make sure you’re comfortable with what you’re putting out there. Consent is key, luvies!

So, if you’re feeling fierce and ready to slay, join the silhouette challenge and show the world your inner diva! Just remember to drop it like it’s hot (but keep it classy, ofc). Can’t wait to see y’all shining bright like diamonds in the dark! Let’s go, babes! 💃🔥 #SilhouetteChallenge #GirlPower
