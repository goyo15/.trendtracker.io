# Slang and phrases popular among teens — 2025-12-16

Hey, squad! Let's spill the tea on the hottest slang and phrases that are totally lit among teens right now. From "sksksk" to "and I oop-" and "stan" to "yasss queen", there's a whole new language taking over the teen world. And you know what? It's boujee AF!

We're out here flexing with our "vibes" and living our best lives as we "low key" turn up with our "ride or die" crew. It's all about the "glow up" and staying slaying, am I right?

So, if you wanna keep it 💯 and not be a "basic" anymore, start adding these phrases to your vocab and you'll be serving looks and snatching wigs in no time. And remember, stay woke and keep it real, because being "extra" is so last season!

Catch you on the flip side, fam! Keep slaying and stay boujee. Peace out! ✌️ #TeenSlang #StayLit
