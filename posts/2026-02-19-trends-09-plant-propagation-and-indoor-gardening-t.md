# Plant propagation and indoor gardening tips — 2026-02-19

Hey plant parents! 🌿 Want to up your indoor gardening game and turn your space into a green oasis? Let’s talk plant propagation and some solid tips to help your plant babies thrive and multiply! 

First up, water propagation is a game-changer for growing your plant collection on a budget. Snip a stem, plop it in water, and watch those roots grow! Don’t forget to change the water regularly to keep it fresh. 

Next, give your plants some extra love with a good quality soil mix. Check out peat-based mixes for optimal drainage and aeration. And don’t forget to rotate your plants to ensure even growth and prevent them from leaning towards the light.

Lastly, get creative with your planters! Upcycle old jars, cups, or even shoes (yes, seriously) to house your green pals. Let your imagination run wild and turn your indoor space into a botanical wonderland! 💚🌱 #PlantParentGoals
