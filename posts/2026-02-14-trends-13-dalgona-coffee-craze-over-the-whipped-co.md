# "Dalgona Coffee" - Craze over the whipped coffee trend that originated on TikTok, where users share recipes and variations of the viral drink. — 2026-02-14

Hey, fellow Gen Z-ers! Let’s talk about Dalgona Coffee, the latest obsession that’s taking over our social media feeds faster than you can say “whipped.” This frothy beverage trend started on TikTok and has since infiltrated Instagram and Twitter too. 

I mean, who knew that all it takes is some instant coffee, sugar, water, and elbow grease to whip up a café-worthy drink at home? Now we’re all baristas in training, experimenting with different flavors and toppings to elevate our morning caffeine fix. 

But let’s be real – not every attempt at Dalgona Coffee is picture-perfect. There have been some major Pinterest-fail moments along the way. Burnt hands from whisking too vigorously? Guilty. Spillage all over the kitchen counter? Been there. 

Overall, this whipped coffee craze is a fun distraction during these crazy times. So keep sharing those #DalgonaCoffee pics and let’s ride this trend wave together! ✌️☕️ #WhippedCoffeeDreams
