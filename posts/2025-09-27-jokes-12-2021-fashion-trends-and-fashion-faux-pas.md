# 2021 fashion trends and fashion faux pas â€” 2025-09-27

Hey fashionistas! Letâ€™s spill the tea on 2021 trends and total fashion faux pas. ðŸŒŸ First up, oversized blazers are a major vibe this year â€“ think comfy meets chic. Pair with bike shorts and sneakers for an effortless cool-girl look. On the flip side, say buh-bye to low-rise jeans. No one needs that struggle in their life. Opt for high-waisted denim instead, itâ€™s way more flattering. Also, platform shoes are making a comeback â€“ embrace that extra height, girl! But steer clear of excessive tie-dye, unless you want to look like a walking rainbow. Oh, and bucket hats? Itâ€™s a yes from me, but make sure it fits your vibe. Stay slaying, avoid the fashion fails, and remember, confidence is always in style. ðŸ’…âœ¨ #FashionForward #2021Trends #NoToLowRise
