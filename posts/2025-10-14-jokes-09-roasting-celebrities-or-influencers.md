# Roasting celebrities or influencers — 2025-10-14

Hey fam, let’s talk about roasting celebrities and influencers for a sec. It’s like the ultimate guilty pleasure, am I right? We love to dish out the spicy burns and hilarious jokes, but let’s keep it real – they’re people too. 

Sure, they put themselves out there for fame and fortune, but that doesn’t give us a free pass to be straight-up mean. There’s a fine line between playful teasing and straight-up disrespect. Remember, they have feelings just like us, except maybe a few million more followers.

Instead of throwing shade, let’s focus on lifting each other up, spreading positivity, and using our words for good. Share that meme, make that joke, but do it with love and respect. So, next time you feel like roasting a celeb, ask yourself – is this really necessary? Let’s keep it light, keep it fun, and remember we’re all just trying to live our best lives. Peace out, fam! #SpreadPositivity 🌟✌️🔥
