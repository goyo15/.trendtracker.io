# Oversized Layers: Styling oversized sweaters, jackets, and coats for a cozy, relaxed look. — 2025-12-22

Hey lovelies! 💖 Let's talk oversized layers - the ultimate cozy chic trend that's taken over my wardrobe! Whether it’s a slouchy sweater, a baggy jacket, or a roomy coat, oversized layers are all about that effortlessly cool vibe. 

First things first, embrace the volume! Go for pieces that look like you borrowed them from your cool older sibling's closet. Pair your oversized sweater with some skinny jeans or leggings to balance out the bulk. Add some chunky sneakers or ankle boots to keep the look on point.

Layering is key! Mix and match different textures and lengths to create depth and interest. A cropped top peeking out from underneath an oversized jacket adds a touch of edge to the outfit.

And don't forget the accessories! Chunky scarves, beanies, and oversized sunglasses are the perfect finishing touches to rock that cozy, relaxed look. So go big or go home, babes! Oversized layers for the win! 🙌✨ #CozyChic #OversizedLayers #StyleInspo
