# School and homework humor — 2026-02-06

Hey there, fellow students! Let’s talk about the hilarious world of school and homework humor. We all know the struggle of procrastinating on assignments until the last minute or feeling like we’re drowning in a sea of homework. But hey, laughter is the best medicine, right?

Who else can relate to checking your grades online and feeling like you need to call 911 for your failing GPA? Or how about the classic excuse of “my dog ate my homework”? Like, really, who even falls for that anymore? And let’s not forget the joy of group projects, where one person does all the work and the rest just show up on presentation day like they did something.

So, next time you’re stressed about schoolwork, just remember to find the humor in it all. Because let’s face it, if we didn’t laugh, we’d probably cry. Stay witty, stay sassy, and keep rocking that homework game, pals! ✌️ #HomeworkHumor #SchoolStruggles
