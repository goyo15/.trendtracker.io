# VSCO girl style — 2025-10-26

Hey fellow teens! Let's talk VSCO girl style. From hydro flasks to scrunchies, this trend is taking over and I am here for it! The laid-back, beachy vibes are so chill and perfect for summer. I mean, who doesn't love oversized tees, Birkenstocks, and messy buns?

But let's not forget the environmental aspect – reusable straws and saving the turtles? Yes, please! And don't even get me started on the love for all things natural – from simple makeup to embracing our natural hair textures.

So, whether you're a VSCO girl yourself or just love the aesthetic, there's something undeniably cool about this trend. It's all about feeling comfortable, eco-friendly, and carefree. So grab your metal straw, slip on those Crocs, and let's ride the wave of VSCO girl style together! #SaveTheTurtles🐢🌊✌️
