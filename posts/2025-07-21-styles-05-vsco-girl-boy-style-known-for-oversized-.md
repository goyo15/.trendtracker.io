Hey there trendy peeps! ðŸŒŸ Let's talk about the VSCO girl/boy style that's been taking over our feeds lately. First off, oversized tees are the move - comfy and cute, what more could we ask for? And let's not forget the scrunchies, because who doesn't love a good hair accessory moment?

Birkenstocks have basically become our go-to footwear, am I right? They're versatile and totally on trend. And don't even get me started on the iconic Hydro Flask water bottles - hydration never looked so stylish!

So, if you're all about that laid-back, outdoorsy vibe, the VSCO girl/boy style is definitely for you. Embrace the oversized tees, rock those scrunchies, slide into those Birks, and sip from that Hydro Flask like it's nobody's business. Stay trendy, my friends! ðŸ’§ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ¸ #VSCOgirlVibes
