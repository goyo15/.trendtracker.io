# Video games jokes â€” 2025-10-23

What's up, gamers? Let's press start on some laughs with video game jokes that'll have you hitting the respawn button in no time! ðŸ˜‚ðŸŽ®

Why was the math book sad? Because it had too many problems! Just like trying to figure out the lore of a Kingdom Hearts game, am I right?

Or how about this one: Why did the console break up with the PC? Because it couldn't handle the space! Just like how I can't handle the stress of trying to beat Dark Souls without raging.

And don't forget the classic: Why was Toad invited to all the parties? Because he's a fungi! Much like the toxicity in a game chat, am I right?

So next time you're feeling down about your K/D ratio or stuck on a tough boss level, just remember: a good video game joke is like a health pack for your soul! Keep gaming and keep laughing, my friends! ðŸŽ®ðŸ˜† #gamersunite
