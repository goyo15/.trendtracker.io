# Gua Sha and skincare routines — 2026-02-10

Hey, teens! Let's talk Gua Sha and skincare routines, because self-care is a vibe we're totally about. Gua Sha isn't just a fun word to say, it's a game-changer for your skin. This ancient Chinese technique involves using a smooth tool to massage your face, reduce puffiness, and promote circulation. It's like giving your skin a little love tap to look radiant and fresh.

Incorporating Gua Sha into your skincare routine is like adding an extra sprinkle of magic. Pair it with your fave serums and moisturizers for the ultimate glow-up. Plus, it's a chill way to de-stress after a long day of crushing it at school.

So, grab your Gua Sha tool, put on your fave playlist, and show your skin some major love. Your future self will thank you for starting those self-care rituals now. Stay fabulous, my fellow skincare enthusiasts! #GlowUpGoals #SkincareSquad
