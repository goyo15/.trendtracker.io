# TikTok Trends — 2025-07-22

Hey cool cats and kittens 🐱! Let’s talk TikTok trends, shall we? From the Renegade dance craze to the Savage Challenge, this app never fails to keep us entertained. But let’s be real, some trends are just straight-up cringy. I mean, who thought the “Hit or Miss” song was a good idea? And don’t even get me started on the “Fruit Jelly Candy Challenge”... Seriously, what even is that? 🤷🏻‍♀️

But hey, for every cringy trend, there’s a gem like the #BlindingLightsChallenge or the #SavageLove dance. TikTok has a way of bringing out our creativity and getting us hooked on the latest viral challenges. So, whether you’re a dance enthusiast or a lip-sync master, there’s always something for everyone on this app.

So, keep scrolling, keep dancing, and remember, not every trend is worth trying… but hey, at least we’ll have some great memories to look back on! 💃🏼✨ #TikTokTrends #StayHip
