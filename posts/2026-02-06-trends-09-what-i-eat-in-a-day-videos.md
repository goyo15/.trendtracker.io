# "What I Eat in a Day" videos — 2026-02-06

Hey peeps, let's talk about those "What I Eat in a Day" videos that are flooding our feeds lately. At first, I was all for them - getting meal inspo and all that jazz. But hold up, are they setting unreal expectations for our diets? I mean, not everyone can afford fancy superfoods or spend hours in the kitchen like these influencers claim to do.

Let's get real - most of us are just trying to survive on a packet of instant ramen or some leftover pizza. And that's totally okay! We need to remember that everyone's body is different, and it's all about balance and what works for YOU.

So, the next time you watch one of these videos, take it with a grain of salt (or a sprinkle of nutritional yeast, if that's your thing). Your worth isn't determined by what's on your plate. Keep it real and stay true to yourself, fam! ✌️ #EatForYou #RealTalk
