# Mental health awareness - #selfcare and destigmatizing therapy â€” 2025-10-17

Hey there, fellow teens! Letâ€™s talk about something super important today - mental health awareness! Itâ€™s time to break the stigma and open up about taking care of our minds. #Selfcare isnâ€™t just about face masks and bubble baths (although those are great too), itâ€™s about prioritizing our mental well-being.

Therapy is NOT something to be ashamed of! Itâ€™s like going to the doctor when youâ€™re sick - taking care of your mental health is just as crucial as your physical health. So letâ€™s normalize chatting with a therapist, counselor, or trusted adult about whatâ€™s going on in our heads.

Remember, itâ€™s okay to not be okay sometimes. Letâ€™s support each other, have open conversations, and show kindness and empathy. Mental health matters, and taking steps to take care of ourselves is empowering! Letâ€™s break the stigma, seek help when we need it, and spread love and positivity. Youâ€™re never alone in this journey! ðŸ’ªðŸ’• #EndTheStigma
