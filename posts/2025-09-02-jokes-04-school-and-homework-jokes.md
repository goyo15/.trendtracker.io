# School and homework jokes — 2025-09-02

Hey there, fellow students! Let's take a break from algebra and dive into some school and homework jokes because we all need a good laugh to survive the academic grind. 

Why did the math book look sad? Because it had too many problems! 😂 And speaking of math, why was the equal sign so humble? Because he knew he wasn't less than or greater than anyone else! 

When the teacher asked me why I didn't do my homework, I told her I was practicing mindfulness by living in the present moment. 🧘‍♀️ 

And let's not forget the classic excuse of "my dog ate my homework." Seriously, how many dogs are out there with a craving for calculus worksheets? 🐶📝

So next time you're drowning in assignments, remember to add a sprinkle of humor to lighten the load. And hey, if all else fails, just remember that laughter is the best distraction from that looming essay deadline! ✨ #SchoolJokes #HomeworkHumor
