# Teenage Stereotypes and Types of Friends — 2026-01-14

Hey, squad! Let’s talk about teenage stereotypes and the different types of friends we encounter in high school. 🌟

First off, let’s ditch the stereotypes, okay? It’s time to break free from the labels society tries to slap on us. Jocks, nerds, popular kids - whatever. We’re more than just a stereotype, we’re unique individuals with our own passions and quirks.

Now, let’s chat about friends. You’ve got your ride-or-die besties - the ones you can always count on no matter what. Then there are the friends who come and go, teaching you valuable lessons along the way. And let’s not forget the new friends who unexpectedly become a huge part of your life.

Remember, it’s not about fitting into a certain friend group, it’s about surrounding yourself with people who lift you up and bring out the best in you. Embrace your true self and let your vibe attract your tribe. ✨ #FriendshipGoals #BreakTheStereotypes
