# Social media and screen time — 2025-07-28

Hey, squad! Let’s talk about the ultimate struggle of our generation – social media and screen time! I get it, we’re all guilty of spending way too many hours scrolling through our feeds, double-tapping on pics, and watching funny TikToks. But let’s be real, that screen time can seriously mess with our mental health and productivity.

I’m not saying ditch social media altogether, let’s just find a healthy balance, fam! Set some boundaries, like no phones at the dinner table or taking tech breaks during study sessions. And remember, those perfectly curated Instagram feeds? They’re not real life, so don’t compare yourself!

So, let’s be the generation that knows when to unplug, look up from our screens, and live our best lives IRL. Trust me, your future self will thank you for it! Stay savvy, stay balanced, and remember to always keep it real!✌️ #ScreenTimeStruggles #BalanceIsKey
