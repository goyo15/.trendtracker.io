# Self-deprecating humor — 2025-12-03

Hey, fam! Let's talk about self-deprecating humor – that fine line between hilarious and harmful. I mean, sure, poking fun at ourselves can be a giggle-fest, but where do we draw the line, right? It’s all fun and games until we start believing the jokes we make about ourselves.

Listen up, squad – we're all amazing in our own ways, and self-love is where it's at! It's cool to laugh at ourselves, but let's not let it chip away at our self-worth. We're way too lit for that!

So, next time you crack a self-deprecating joke, ask yourself: is this bringing good vibes or am I low-key dissing myself? Keep it sassy, keep it classy, and remember, you're a boss babe with killer style and mad skills. Own it, slay it, and stay fabulous, my peeps! Let's keep it real – self-love always wins! #StayPositive #YoureLit
