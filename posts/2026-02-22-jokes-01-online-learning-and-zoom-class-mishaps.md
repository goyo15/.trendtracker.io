# Online learning and Zoom class mishaps — 2026-02-22

OMG, can we talk about the struggle of online learning and Zoom class mishaps? 😩 Like, can my WiFi PLEASE cooperate for just one freaking hour? And don’t even get me started on accidentally unmuting myself and revealing my embarrassing love for K-pop to the entire class. 🙈 It’s like a constant battle between looking presentable for Zoom camera on and staying in my pajamas all day, you feel me? Let’s not forget the awkward silence when the teacher asks a question and everyone’s just staring at each other through the screen. Can we just fast forward to the day when we can actually attend class in person and not have to deal with these technical difficulties? Until then, let’s just embrace the chaos and keep those mute buttons handy. Stay strong, my fellow Zoom warriors. 💻✌️ #OnlineLearningStruggles #ZoomClassFails
