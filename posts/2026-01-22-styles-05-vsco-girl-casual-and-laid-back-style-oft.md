# VSCO Girl: Casual and laid-back style often associated with environmental consciousness, featuring oversized T-shirts, scrunchies, and Hydro Flask water bottles. — 2026-01-22

Hey hey, my trendy peeps! Let’s talk about the VSCO girl craze that’s taking over our feeds faster than you can say, “Save the turtles!” 🐢🌊 Rocking oversized tees, scrunchies for days, and sipping from Hydro Flask water bottles like they’re the elixir of life, these girls are all about that casual, laid-back vibe with a side of eco-consciousness. So next time you see someone sporting a metal straw or a Pura Vida bracelet, you know they’re part of the VSCO squad. And don’t even get me started on their love for Birkenstocks and Fjallraven Kanken backpacks! 🎒💁🏼‍♀️ Whether you’re already a VSCO girl or just vibing with their style, remember to always spread positive energy, champion sustainability, and, of course, snap those #savetheturtles selfies like a boss. Stay groovy, stay VSCO! 🌸✌️ #LiveLaughVSCO #Sksksksk
