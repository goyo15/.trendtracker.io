Hey gamers!

Let's talk about video game jokes, because what's better than laughing while pwning noobs, am I right? From witty one-liners to clever references, video game jokes bring a whole new level of fun to our favorite virtual worlds.

You know you're a true gamer when you laugh at jokes about lag being a player's worst enemy or introverts choosing to socialize in online multiplayer games.
