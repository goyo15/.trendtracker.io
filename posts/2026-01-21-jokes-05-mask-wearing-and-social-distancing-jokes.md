# Mask-wearing and social distancing jokes — 2026-01-21

Hey there, fellow mask-wearing warriors! Can we talk about the latest trend in humor - mask-wearing and social distancing jokes? I mean, come on, we’ve been wearing our masks and keeping our distance for what feels like a million years now. And let’s be real, at this point, we could all use a good laugh.

Sure, some of these jokes might be a bit overused (*cough* “Hey, I like your mask! Oh wait, that’s just your face” *cough*), but hey, they bring a little bit of lightness to a pretty heavy situation. And let’s not forget about the creative ways people are incorporating masks into their Halloween costumes – now that’s next level!

So, whether you’re rolling your eyes or rolling on the floor laughing at these jokes, let’s remember to keep our sense of humor intact while we navigate this new normal. Stay safe, stay masked, and keep the jokes coming! #MaskOnLaughOn 🤣✌️🌟
