# Dalgona coffee trend — 2026-01-02

Hey fam! 👋☕️ Let’s spill the tea on the Dalgona coffee trend that’s taking over the ‘gram! This frothy, whipped coffee concoction has got everyone feeling like a pro barista. With just equal parts instant coffee, sugar, and hot water whipped together, you can create a picture-perfect, Insta-worthy coffee treat.

But let’s be real – is it worth the hype? Sure, it looks cute and tastes delish, but that arm workout from all that whipping is no joke! And let’s not forget the mess it makes in the kitchen (RIP to all the spilled coffee grounds). Despite the mixed reviews, I gotta admit, sipping on a fluffy Dalgona coffee while scrolling through TikTok hits different.

So, whether you’re a coffee addict or just trying to jump on the trend train, give Dalgona coffee a shot and let me know what you think. Are you team YASS or team PASS on this viral coffee craze? Let’s spill the tea in the comments! 💁‍♀️☕️ #DalgonaCoffee #TrendyTreats #CoffeeQueen
