# Preppy schoolgirl look — 2025-12-14

Hey fam! Let’s talk about the preppy schoolgirl look that’s been slaying it lately. Think Cher from Clueless meets Blair Waldorf from Gossip Girl. You know, collared shirts, pleated skirts, and of course, the iconic plaid patterns. 

This look is all about sophistication with a touch of sass. Pair a crisp white blouse with a cute plaid skirt and throw on some loafers or Mary Janes to complete the outfit. Don’t forget the accessories like a statement headband or a classy pearl necklace.

The preppy schoolgirl vibe is all about looking put-together and classy with a hint of rebellion. So, rock that look with confidence and show off your style to the world. Stay fab, stay fierce! ✨ #PreppyVibes #SchoolGirlChic
