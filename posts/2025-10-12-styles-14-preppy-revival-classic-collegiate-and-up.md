# Preppy Revival (Classic collegiate and upscale casual) — 2025-10-12

Hey babes, get ready to make a statement with the Preppy Revival trend – think classic collegiate vibes with a modern twist! We're talking plaid skirts, crisp button-downs, and loafers for days. Embrace that upscale casual look that screams "I go to a fancy Ivy League school but also know how to have fun on the weekends."

Mix and match your preppy pieces with streetwear staples to keep things fresh and edgy. Throw on a varsity sweater over your graphic tee, or pair your tailored blazer with some ripped jeans. Accessorize with pearls, headbands, or a sleek watch to add a touch of sophistication.

Whether you're hitting the books or just hanging out with your squad, the Preppy Revival trend is perfect for any occasion. So grab your favorite plaid skirt and get ready to show off your classic yet totally chic style! 💁🏼‍♀️✨ #PreppyRevival #StayClassyCasual
