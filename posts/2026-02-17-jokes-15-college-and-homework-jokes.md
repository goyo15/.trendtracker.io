# College and homework jokes — 2026-02-17

Hey hey, my fellow disenchanted teens! Let’s talk about college and homework jokes – because sometimes you just gotta laugh to keep from crying, am I right?

Like, when the professor assigns a 20-page paper on top of an exam and you’re like, “Sure, let me just add ‘miracle worker’ to my resume real quick.” Or when you finally finish a project only to find out it was due a week ago – thanks for the heads up, teach!

And don’t even get me started on group projects. It’s always that one person who disappears into the Bermuda Triangle of responsibility, leaving you to carry the team like you’re Hercules or something.

So, here’s to all the college struggles and late-night study sessions – may our coffee be strong and our Wi-Fi connections be stronger. Keep grinding, stay sassy, and remember: laughter is the best medicine, especially when it comes to surviving academia. Peace out!
