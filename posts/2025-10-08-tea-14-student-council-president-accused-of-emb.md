# Student council president accused of embezzling funds meant for charity events. — 2025-10-08

Hey fam, can you believe the drama going down at our school?! 🙄 Our so-called student council president has been accused of straight-up EM-BEZ-ZLING funds that were supposed to go towards charity events! Like, seriously, who does that?? 

We all voted for this person to lead us and now they’re out here betraying our trust like it’s NBD. SMH. I mean, we worked hard to raise that money and now it’s just gone, vanished into thin air. It’s not just about the cash, it’s about the impact those funds could’ve had on those in need. It’s disappointing, it’s infuriating, it’s just... ugh.

This whole situation is like a bad episode of a teen drama, but sadly, it’s real life. Can we just get someone trustworthy in that position next time? Kthxbai. 🤦‍♀️ #StudentCouncilScandal #CharityFundsGoneMissing
