# Millennials vs. Gen Z - Humorous comparisons between millennials and Gen Z humor styles and preferences are trending. — 2025-11-03

Hey guys! So, the internet is buzzing with all these hilarious comparisons between Millennials and Gen Z humor, and let me tell you, it is seriously cracking me up! 😂

Millennials be like: “Remember when Vine was a thing? RIP Vine, you will always have a place in our hearts.” 🌱

Meanwhile, Gen Z is out here like: “Bruh, TikTok is life! If you don’t know the latest TikTok dance, you are totally living under a rock!” 💃

And don’t even get me started on memes! Millennials are all about those classic, timeless memes like the “Distracted Boyfriend” and “Hide the Pain Harold”. 😆

But Gen Z? They are all about the meta, self-aware memes that leave you questioning the fabric of reality itself. 🤯

It’s just too funny how different our humor styles are, but hey, we can all agree that laughter is the best medicine, no matter what generation you belong to! 🤣✌️ #GenerationalHumor #LaughOutLoud
