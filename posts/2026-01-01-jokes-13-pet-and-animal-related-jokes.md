Why did the dog sit in the shade? Because he didn't want to be a hot dog! 🌭 And how does a penguin build its house? Igloos it together! 🐧

So next time you're feeling a bit ruff, don't paws to share a furry joke with your friends. It's time to unleash those animal puns and bring some joy to your day. Stay wild and keep laughing! 🐾 #AnimalJokes #PawsAndLaughs
