# Animal jokes — 2025-07-13

Hey, party animals! Let’s talk about the real MVPs of the internet: animal jokes. Whether you live for puns about paws or can’t resist a good meow-ment, animal jokes are the cat’s pajamas of comedy. From dad jokes about the birds and the bees to puns that are totally un-bear-able (in a good way), there’s something for everyone in the animal kingdom of humor. So, why did the squirrel bring a hammer to bed? Because he wanted to hit the snooze button! Classic, am I right? So next time you need a pick-me-up, don’t be koi – dive into some animal jokes and let the laughter roar. And remember, when in doubt, just wing it! That’s all for now, stay wild and keep the jokes comin’! ✌️🐾 #AnimalJokes #PunnyHumor
