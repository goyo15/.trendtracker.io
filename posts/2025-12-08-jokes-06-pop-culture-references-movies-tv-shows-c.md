# Pop culture references (movies, TV shows, celebrities) — 2025-12-08

Hey fam! Let's talk pop culture references, because let's be real, they're basically the spices that add flavor to our daily convos. Whether you're dropping a line from your fave movie like "You're killing me, Smalls!" or using a celeb as a comparison ("She's as fierce as Beyoncé"), pop culture is the universal language we speak. 

TV shows give us iconic moments like Monica's turkey on the head in Friends, while movies like Mean Girls have gifted us with phrases that never get old ("On Wednesdays, we wear pink"). And don't even get me started on celebrities - they're like the real-life superheroes we stan. 

So, next time you're chatting with your squad, sprinkle in some pop culture references and watch the vibes level up. Stay trendy, stay witty, and keep slaying those pop culture references like a boss! 💁🏽‍♀️🔥 #PopCultureQueen #SlayAllDay #SpiceUpYourLife
