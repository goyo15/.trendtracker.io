# Memes and internet culture references — 2025-11-17

Hey fam! Let's talk about memes and internet culture references - because let's be real, they rule the online world! 🌐💥 From SpongeBob SquarePants to Kermit sippin' tea, these memes have become our go-to way to express ourselves in the digital age. We're basically fluent in meme speak at this point! 😜🔥

And don't even get me started on Vine references - RIP to the golden era of 6-second masterpieces. Who could forget classics like "What are those?!" or "Road work ahead? Uh, yeah, I sure hope it does!" 🚧😂

But let's not forget the power of TikTok, where trends come and go quicker than you can say "Renegade!" 💃🏻✨ From dances to challenges, this app has taken meme culture to a whole new level. And if you're not up-to-date on the latest viral TikToks, are you even living your best Gen Z life? 🤳🏼💁🏻‍♀️

So next time you drop a "OK, boomer" or a "And I oop-" in casual conversation, just remember - we're shaping the future of internet culture, one meme at a time. Stay woke, stay meme-ing! ✌🏼🔮
