# Random Observations and Stereotypes — 2025-08-29

Hey fam! Let’s talk about some random observations and stereotypes that we gotta address. Like, why do people assume all teens are glued to their phones 24/7? Newsflash, we actually have lives outside of social media, believe it or not. Another thing, why is it that if you’re a girl who loves sports, automatically you’re seen as a “tomboy”? Can’t a girl just enjoy kicking butt on the soccer field without being labeled? Also, can we please stop with the whole “all teenagers are lazy and entitled” stereotype? We’re out here working hard in school, chasing our dreams, and trying to make a difference in the world. So next time you wanna make assumptions about teens, think twice. We’re a diverse and dynamic group, breaking stereotypes one step at a time. Keep shining, friends! ✌️ #TeenPower #BreakTheStereotypes
