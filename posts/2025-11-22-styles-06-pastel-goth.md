# Pastel goth — 2025-11-22

Hey fam, let's chat about the rad world of pastel goth! 💜🖤 Mixing soft pastel colors with edgy goth vibes? Absolute perfection. It's like the best of both worlds colliding in a beautiful storm of badassery. Rocking pastel goth style means slaying in layers of lace, fishnet, and chokers while still keeping it cute with a pop of pastel pink or mint green. 🦄🖤 And let's not forget about the killer makeup looks – dark lips, pastel eyeshadows, and maybe a touch of glitter to top it off. Talk about serving some serious looks! So if you're into being a rebel with a sweet side, pastel goth might just be your new fave aesthetic. Stay fierce, stay fabulous, and keep slaying those pastel goth vibes, my queens and kings! 🔮💀 #PastelGothGoals #SlayAllDay 💅🏼💄
