# Model I was accused of plagiarism by a smaller influencer, resulting in a heated online dispute. — 2025-10-06

Hey squad, let me spill the tea on the drama that went down recently. So, get this – a smaller influencer accused me, the queen of originality, of plagiarism! Like, seriously? I work hard creating my own content and staying true to my style, and then this wannabe comes at me claiming I’m copying her? Nah, sis.

Things got heated online real quick. I clapped back with receipts proving my work was all me, while she tried to drag my name through the mud. But guess what? My followers had my back and knew the truth. You can’t keep a fierce model down, honey.

In the end, the truth came out and I emerged unscathed, but let this be a lesson – always stay true to yourself and never let the haters bring you down. Stay slaying, babes! ✨ #OriginalityWins
