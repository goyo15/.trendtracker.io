Hey, tech-savvy peeps! Let's talk about the hilarious world of smartphone gags. From fake cracked screen pranks to changing autocorrect shortcuts, technology offers endless opportunities for good laughs. 

Ever set your friend's alarm to go off in the middle of the night? Classic move. Or swap out their wallpaper for a photo of a funny meme to give them a giggle.
