# Pet Peeves and Annoying Habits — 2025-10-12

Hey fam, let’s talk about pet peeves and annoying habits that totally irk us on a daily basis. Like, seriously, why do people walk slow in the hallway like it’s a leisurely stroll in the park? And don’t even get me started on loud chewers during lunchtime - it’s like a symphony of grossness.

And what’s up with folks who constantly interrupt when you’re trying to spill the tea about your latest drama? Hello, can you let me finish my sentence without butting in with your own story?

Also, can we take a moment to address the nail-biters in class? It’s not a cute look to have half-nibbled fingers, just saying.

Let’s all agree to ditch these annoying habits and make the world a more chill place to vibe in. Or at least, try to be a bit more aware of the stuff that drives us all cray-cray. Peace out, peeps! 🙅‍♀️🙄✌️
