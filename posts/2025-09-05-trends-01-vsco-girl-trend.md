# "VSCO Girl" trend — 2025-09-05

Hey fellow teens,

Let’s talk about the “VSCO Girl” trend that’s taking over our social feeds. From oversized t-shirts to scrunchies and reusable water bottles, it’s like we’ve all collectively decided to channel our inner carefree beach vibes.

But here’s the thing – being a VSCO Girl is more than just the accessories. It’s about embracing a laid-back, sustainable lifestyle and promoting positivity online. Sure, the hydro flasks and the metal straws are cool, but let’s not forget the message behind it all: taking care of our planet and spreading good vibes.

So, whether you’re rocking the oversized tee and scrunchie combo or just admiring from afar, let’s remember the heart of the VSCO Girl trend – spreading positivity, caring for our planet, and being unapologetically ourselves. Stay groovy, my VSCO babes 🌿✌️ #Sksksk #SaveTheTurtles #VSCOGirlLife
