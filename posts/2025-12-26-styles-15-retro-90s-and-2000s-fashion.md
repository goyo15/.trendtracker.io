# Retro 90s and 2000s fashion — 2025-12-26

Hey fellow fashionistas, let’s talk about the totally rad trend making a major comeback - retro 90s and 2000s fashion! From low-rise jeans to chunky sneakers, these nostalgic pieces are popping up everywhere, and I am here for it!

Who else is loving the oversized graphic tees, scrunchies, and mini backpacks? It’s giving me all the Clueless meets Mean Girls vibes. And let’s not forget about the iconic butterfly clips and cargo pants - they’re so fetch!

Not gonna lie, raiding my mom’s old wardrobe for vintage gems has become my new favorite pastime. With celebs like Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid rocking these throwback looks on the daily, it’s safe to say that 90s and 2000s fashion is back and better than ever.

So, grab your butterfly clips and tie-dye tops, because we’re about to slay this retro fashion moment! Stay fab, my fellow trendsetters! #ThrowbackFashionGoals
