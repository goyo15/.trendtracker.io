# Controversial challenges on social media platforms â€” 2025-09-14

Hey, fellow teens! Letâ€™s talk about the latest trend plaguing social media platforms â€“ controversial challenges. While challenges like the Ice Bucket Challenge raised awareness for a good cause, some of the current challenges are downright dangerous. From the Tide Pod Challenge to the Skull Breaker Challenge, itâ€™s like some people have lost their common sense along with their TikTok filters. 

Sure, participating in these challenges might give you a few seconds of fame, but at what cost? Broken bones, poisoning, or even death? How many likes and shares are worth risking your safety? Letâ€™s use our platforms for positivity, not stupidity. Let's #challenge ourselves to spread kindness, raise awareness on important issues, and support one another instead of falling for the latest dumb trend. Remember, youâ€™re worth more than the number of views on a video. Stay safe, stay smart, and stay fabulous! TTYL! ðŸ˜˜ #TeenBlogger #ThinkBeforeYouTrend
