# Self-deprecating humor â€” 2025-09-16

Hey there, fellow teens! Let's talk about self-deprecating humor, shall we? You know, that style of comedy where we poke fun at ourselves to get a laugh. Now, don't get me wrong, a little self-deprecation here and there can be totally relatable and funny. I mean, who hasn't made a joke about their own clumsiness or love for junk food?

But here's the thing: there's a fine line between lighthearted self-deprecation and straight-up self-dragging. It's all fun and games until you start believing the negative stuff you're saying about yourself. Remember, we're all awesome in our own unique ways, and it's important to practice self-love and kindness, even when we're just trying to crack a joke.

So, let's keep the self-deprecating humor light and fluffy like a freshly baked soufflÃ©, and remember that we're all fabulous just the way we are. Stay witty, stay sassy, and keep shining bright, my friends! ðŸ˜„âœ¨ #LoveYourself #StayFabulous
