Hey, teens! Have you tried the latest viral drink trend yet? Dalgona coffee is taking over social media, and it’s not just because it looks Insta-worthy (although, let’s be real, it totally does). This whipped coffee concoction is super easy to make with just three simple ingredients: instant coffee, sugar, and hot water. 

Just whip them together until you get a fluffy, cloud-like texture and spoon it over your choice of milk. It’s like having your own coffee shop creation right in your kitchen!

But the best part? You can customize it to your liking by adding flavors like vanilla or cinnamon. Plus, it’ll give you that extra boost of caffeine for those long days of virtual learning or late-night TikTok sessions. So, grab your whisk and get ready to join the #dalgonacoffee craze! Trust me, your taste buds will thank you.
