Hey fam! Let's face it, school and homework can be a total mood, am I right? 📚😅 Whether you're dodging a math test or pulling an all-nighter for that essay, we've all been there, done that! Let's spice up the stress with some relatable jokes about our fav subjects and teachers: 

Why did the student eat his homework? Because the teacher said it was a piece of cake! 🍰😂 

What did the pencil say to the paper? I dot you, babe! 📝😆 

Why did the math book look sad? Because it had too many problems! 🧮😭 

And let's not forget those iconic teacher one-liners: "I'll wait... 😉" or "Do you understand, or do you need me to explain it again in a different way for the 100th time?" 🙄

Keep shining, stay lit, and remember, we're all in this struggle together! School may be tough, but our humor is even tougher. Catch ya later! 🔥✌️ #SchoolSquadGoals #HomeworkHilarity
