# School and online learning humor — 2025-07-25

Hey there, fellow teens! Let's talk about the ridiculousness of online learning because, let's be real, we've all been there. 

First off, can we just take a moment to appreciate the sheer irony of having a "digital citizenship" class when half the time we're just trying to sneak in a quick TikTok session during math class? And don't even get me started on the awkward moments when your teacher forgets to turn off their mic and you get a front-row seat to all their mumbling and background noises.

And how about those online tests that make you feel like you've accidentally stumbled into the Bermuda Triangle of technology? One second you're uploading your answer and the next you're magically transported to a completely different page. It's like playing a game of virtual hide-and-seek, except no one's having any fun.

But hey, at least we can always count on our classmates to provide some comic relief with their never-ending array of Zoom background fails. Cheers to surviving the chaos of online learning – one meme at a time!
