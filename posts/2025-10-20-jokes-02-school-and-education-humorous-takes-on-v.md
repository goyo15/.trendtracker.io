Who else has experienced the joy of accidentally turning on their mic while complaining about an assignment? Or how about the teacher who insists on using virtual backgrounds that glitch out and make them look like theyâ€™re floating heads? Classic!

But hey, despite the chaos, letâ€™s give props to our teachers who are doing their best to navigate this whole online schooling thing. So hereâ€™s to all the virtual eye-rolls and silent laughs - keep pushing through, we got this! ðŸ“šðŸ’» #TeenLife #OnlineLearning #TeacherQuirks
