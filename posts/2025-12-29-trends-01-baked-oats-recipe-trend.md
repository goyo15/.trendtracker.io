# Baked oats recipe trend — 2025-12-29

Hey fam, let’s talk about the latest food trend taking over TikTok – Baked Oats! Move over avocado toast, because these baked oats are taking breakfast to a whole new level. It’s like the lovechild of a muffin and oatmeal, and let me tell you, it’s downright delicious.

Here’s the lowdown: you mix up your oats with milk, sweetener, and any other mix-ins your heart desires (chocolate chips, fruit, nuts – the possibilities are endless), pour it into a baking dish, and pop it in the oven. Voila, a warm, cozy, and perfectly Instagrammable breakfast is born.

Whether you’re a breakfast lover or just looking to up your TikTok cooking game, this trend is a must-try. Trust me, your taste buds will thank you. Now excuse me while I go bake up some oats and take some bomb selfies with my new fave breakfast dish. TTYL! ✌️ #bakedoats #trendalert #breakfastgoals
