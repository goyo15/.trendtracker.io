# Back-to-school humor — 2026-02-17

Hey, fam! As we gear up for another year of hitting the books, let’s not forget to add a little humor to our back-to-school routine. Whether it’s laughing at your own awkward hallway encounters or finding the humor in your packed-to-the-brim locker, back-to-school season is ripe with comedic opportunities.

From the cringe-worthy fashion choices on the first day to the struggles of deciphering your class schedule, there’s no shortage of material for those hilarious back-to-school memes. And let’s not overlook the classic struggle of trying to find your classroom on the first day – we’ve all been there, wandering around lost like a bewildered penguin.

So, let’s embrace the chaos of the back-to-school madness and remember to laugh a little along the way. After all, laughter is the best way to survive the inevitable homework overload and early mornings. Stay funny, stay fierce, and remember to rock that first day with style and sass! 💁🏼‍♀️✨ #BackToSchoolLaughs #SurvivingHighSchool
