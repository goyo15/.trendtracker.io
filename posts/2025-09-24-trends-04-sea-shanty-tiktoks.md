# Sea Shanty TikToks — 2025-09-24

Yo, fellow Gen Zers! Let’s talk about the latest TikTok trend that’s got us all singing along - Sea Shanty TikToks! 🌊🎶 Whether you’re a seasoned sailor or just a landlubber like me, there’s no denying the catchy tunes and harmonies of these sea shanties taking over our FYPs. From “The Wellerman” to “Drunken Sailor”, these traditional sailor songs have been given a modern twist and are making waves on social media.

I have to admit, I may have found myself belting out a sea shanty or two while doing my homework (shh, don’t tell my parents!). It’s a fun escape from reality and a reminder of simpler times when sailors relied on teamwork and camaraderie to get through tough times at sea. So, if you haven’t already, jump on board the sea shanty trend and let’s set sail on this musical adventure together! ⚓️🎶 #SeaShantyTikToks #SailorLife #YoHoHo
