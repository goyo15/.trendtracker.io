# Fitness and Workout Jokes (e.g., "Why did the bodybuilder bring a ladder to the gym? He heard it was a step workout.") — 2025-08-13

Hey squad! Let’s talk about fitness and workout jokes because let’s face it, we all need a good laugh while sweating it out at the gym. 🏋️‍♂️💦

Why did the gym close down? It just didn’t work out! 😂

Or how about this one: Why did the fitness trainer bring string to the gym? To tie up loose ends! 🧵💪

And my personal fave: Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field… and so are all of us after a killer workout session! 🌾🏆

Remember, fitness is serious business but that doesn’t mean we can’t have some fun along the way. So next time you’re feeling the burn, just remember these jokes and push through! Stay strong, stay sweaty, and keep crushing those goals! 💪💖 #FitnessHumor #GymLife #LaughsAndLunges
