# Exam and test stress jokes — 2025-11-28

Hey, my fellow stressed-out students! Let's take a break from the never-ending cycle of studying and panic attacks to laugh a little with some exam and test stress jokes. Because let's be real, sometimes you just have to find humor in the chaos of it all, am I right?

Why did the math book look sad? Because it had too many problems. 😂

What do you call a test that’s so hard, even the teacher can't answer it? A trick question! 🤯

Feeling overwhelmed by exam stress? Remember, it's not the end of the world. It's just a test. And trust me, in a few years, you'll look back at all the stress and laugh (maybe cry a little too, but mostly laugh).

So take a deep breath, keep on studying, and remember, you're not alone in this crazy rollercoaster ride of exams. And hey, at least we have jokes to get us through it! 📚✏️ #TestStressJokes #LaughItOff
