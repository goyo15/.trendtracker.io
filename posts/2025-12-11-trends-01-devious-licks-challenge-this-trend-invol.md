# "Devious Licks" challenge - This trend involves users filming themselves stealing or damaging items from schools, leading to significant controversy and news coverage. — 2025-12-11

Hey, fam! We need to talk about the whole "Devious Licks" mess that's been all over social media lately. Seriously, what's up with some peeps thinking it's cool to steal or mess up stuff at school just for clout? Newsflash: It's not a vibe, it's straight up whack!

I mean, we get it, social media challenges can be fun and all, but this one is a major fail. Schools are supposed to be places of learning and growth, not a hot spot for destructive behavior. Plus, it's not just harmless fun when you're causing real damage and hurting your own education in the process.

So, let's keep it real, fam. Instead of chasing clout through dumb challenges, let's focus on uplifting each other and making positive impacts in our communities. Let's leave the "Devious Licks" nonsense in the past where it belongs, and show the world that teens can do way better than that. Stay real, stay positive! Peace out. #NotFeelingDeviousLicks
