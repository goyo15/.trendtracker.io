# Cookware Hacks — 2025-09-24

Hey y’all, 

Let’s talk about cookware hacks that’ll take your kitchen game to the next level! Sick of scrubbing pots and pans for ages? Use parchment paper or aluminum foil to line your baking trays for easy cleanup. Want to make your non-stick pans last longer? Skip the metal utensils and stick to silicone or wooden ones. 

Losing your mind over burnt-on food? Fill your stubborn pan with water, add a splash of vinegar, and bring it to a boil to help loosen that mess. And don’t toss those eggshells just yet! Crush them up and sprinkle them in your coffee grounds to reduce bitterness. 

Whether you’re a kitchen beginner or a seasoned pro, these cookware hacks are here to make your life a little easier. Get creative, experiment, and remember - a well-stocked kitchen is a happy kitchen. 

Stay snappy,
