# Excuses for not doing chores — 2025-09-30

Hey fam, let’s talk about the art of crafting excuses for not doing chores. We’ve all been there, staring at the dishes piling up in the sink or the laundry basket overflowing, and suddenly a genius excuse pops into our heads. 

Top excuse #1: “I have an urgent homework assignment due tomorrow!” Classic move, because who can argue with the whole “education comes first” spiel, right?

Excuse #2: “I’m feeling under the weather.” No one wants a sick teen doing chores, right? Play up the sympathy card and you might just get out of scrubbing toilets.

And the ultimate go-to excuse #3: “I already did them yesterday!” Sure, it might be a bit of a stretch, but hey, it worked once, right?

Remember, a good excuse is all about timing and delivery. So next time you’re faced with chores, channel your inner excuses master and sail on through! Peace out, chore warriors.
