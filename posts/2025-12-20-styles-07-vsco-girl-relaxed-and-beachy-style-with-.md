# VSCO Girl: Relaxed and beachy style with oversized shirts, scrunchies, and environmentally friendly accessories. — 2025-12-20

Hey all you cool cats and kittens! Let's talk about VSCO girls – the queens of relaxed, beachy style! These girls are all about oversized shirts, scrunchies, and environmentally friendly accessories. They're all about that carefree vibe, with their messy buns and chunky sneakers. And let's not forget the iconic Hydro Flask and metal straws – saving the planet in style!

But being a VSCO girl isn't just about the clothes and accessories – it's a whole vibe. It's about embracing your natural beauty, spreading positivity, and living your best eco-friendly life. It's all about soaking up the sun, feeling the sand between your toes, and sipping on your iced coffee like a boss.

So grab your Fjallraven Kanken backpack, slap on some scrunchies, and live your best VSCO girl life! Stay salty, stay stylish, and above all, stay true to yourself.✌️🌊 #VSCOgirl #SlayinWithScrunchies #SaveTheTurtles
