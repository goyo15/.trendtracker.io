# Social media etiquette and faux pas — 2026-02-02

Hey squad! Let’s spill the tea on social media etiquette because let's be real, some of y’all need a major reality check. First up, stop ghosting your friends online – if they DM you, have the decency to reply! Also, enough with the endless selfies, like we get it, you’re cute but chill with the spam. And don’t even get me started on those who constantly overshare their drama online, like seriously, save the tea for real life. And hey, it’s 2023, time to learn the difference between your and you’re, for real. Lastly, being a keyboard warrior? So last season. If you wouldn’t say it to someone’s face, don’t say it online. So there you have it, follow these rules and you'll be the ultimate social media queen. Stay woke, stay classy ✌️ #socialmediaetiquette #bloggerlife
