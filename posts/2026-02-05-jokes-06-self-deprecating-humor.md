# Self-deprecating humor — 2026-02-05

Hey, fam! Let's talk about self-deprecating humor – the fine art of roasting yourself before anyone else gets the chance. 🤷‍♀️ We've all thrown out a self-roast or two to get a laugh, but where do we draw the line between funny and straight-up self-sabotage?

Sure, poking fun at yourself can be a coping mechanism or a way to bond with peeps, but constantly putting yourself down ain't a cute look. 🙅‍♂️ We're all about boosting each other up, not tearing ourselves down for some cheap laughs.

Remember, you're a boss babe (or bro), and you deserve better than self-deprecating humor that masks your true awesomeness! It's cool to laugh at yourself, but make sure you're not crossing the line into negative self-talk territory. Keep slaying, keep shining, and remember that self-love is the real vibe! 💁‍♀️💖 #PositiveVibesOnly
