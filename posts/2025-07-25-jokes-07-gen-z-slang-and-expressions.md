# Gen Z slang and expressions — 2025-07-25

Hey, fam! Let’s talk about Gen Z slang and expressions that are totally lit right now. From "yeet" to "stan" and "sksksk", our generation has a whole new language that confuses the heck out of the older folks. But hey, that’s just part of our charm, am I right?

We use "snack" to describe someone looking fine, "flex" for showing off, and "lowkey" for keeping things on the down-low. And don’t even get me started on "ghosting" or "flexing on the 'gram". We’ve got a whole dictionary of slang that’s constantly evolving, and it’s what makes us so fresh and on point.

So, next time someone hits you with a "slay queen" or "no cap", remember to keep up with the trends. Because in this fast-paced digital world, if you’re not speaking the lingo, you might as well be ancient history. Stay woke and keep slaying, my fellow Gen Z-ers! Peace out.
