# Millennial vs. Gen Z humor — 2026-01-01

Alright, fam, let’s spill the tea ☕️ on Millennial vs. Gen Z humor. Millies be all about those nostalgic memes and self-deprecating jokes, while Gen Zers are all about that raw, unfiltered humor and absurd TikTok trends. Millies stay nostalgic with their “I'm baby” and “OK boomer” vibes, while Gen Zers ain't afraid to push boundaries with their dark humor and canceled culture references. Like, Millies be all about that dad joke life, while Gen Zers be serving up that chaotic energy with their surreal memes and VSCO girl parodies. But hey, can we all just agree that both generations know how to bring the laughs and keep our feeds lit? At the end of the day, humor is subjective, so let’s just keep vibing and spreading those good vibes, no matter which side of the generational humor spectrum we’re on. Stay iconic, y’all! 💁🏽‍♀️✌🏼 #MillieVsGenZ #SlayTheMemeGame
