# Pet Peeves and Annoying Habits — 2025-11-23

Okay, let’s talk about pet peeves and annoying habits. I swear, some people seriously need a crash course on basic etiquette! Like, why do some folks feel the need to talk loudly on their phone in public places? It’s not a theater, Karen, keep it down! And don’t even get me started on people who chew with their mouths open. It’s like a symphony of grossness that I can’t unhear. And those who constantly interrupt when you’re trying to tell a story? Rude much? But the absolute worst has to be when someone doesn’t use their turn signal while driving. Are you trying to give me a heart attack or what? Let’s agree to leave these annoying habits in 2021, deal? It’s time to level up our manners game, people! #PetPeeves #AnnoyingHabits #RantOver
