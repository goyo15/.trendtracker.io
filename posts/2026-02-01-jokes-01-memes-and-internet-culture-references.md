# Memes and internet culture references — 2026-02-01

Hey fam, let’s talk about the OG of internet culture—memes! These bad boys have taken over our feeds faster than we can say “LOL”. Whether it’s a SpongeBob meme, a Pepe reference, or a Vine throwback, we can’t deny the impact of these viral gems on our daily conversations.

I mean, who needs long paragraphs when you can sum up your mood with a Drake meme or express your struggles with a classic “First World Problems” picture? Memes are the language of the digital age, connecting us in ways we never thought possible.

So next time your friend texts you “I can’t even”, reply with a Kermit sipping tea meme for that extra oomph. Let’s keep the meme madness alive and continue to sprinkle our conversations with internet culture references that make us all feel like one big meme-loving family. Keep on memeing, my friends! #InternetCultureGoals 🙌🏼✨
