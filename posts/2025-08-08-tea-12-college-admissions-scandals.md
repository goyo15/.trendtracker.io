# College admissions scandals â€” 2025-08-08

Hey, squad! Letâ€™s talk about these college admissions scandals that have been blowing up our feeds. ðŸš¨ Seriously, what is up with these rich and famous parents trying to cheat their way into top schools for their kids? ðŸ™„ Itâ€™s like they think theyâ€™re above the law or something.

Meanwhile, us regular teens are over here stressing about our grades, extracurriculars, and actually earning our spots at our dream schools. Itâ€™s not fair that these privileged peeps are taking opportunities away from deserving students who have worked their butts off.

So, letâ€™s use this as a wake-up call to stay true to ourselves, work hard, and remember that integrity and honesty will always take us further than cheating ever will. Letâ€™s show the world that we are more than just a test score or a last name â€“ we are the future, and weâ€™re going to make it on our own merit. ðŸ’ª #NoShortcuts #HardWorkPaysOff
