# Viral dance trends like the "Renegade" and "Savage Love" — 2026-01-17

Hey squad! Let's talk about these viral dance trends that are taking over TikTok faster than you can say "Renegade"! From Charli D'Amelio hitting the "Renegade" with precision to Jason Derulo's smooth moves to "Savage Love", these dance crazes are setting our screens on fire. It's like, one minute you're scrolling through your FYP, and the next, you're standing in front of the mirror trying to nail that choreo. And let's be real, even if you're not the best dancer (like me), you can still have a blast trying to keep up with the latest viral dances. Plus, it's the perfect way to shake off that quarantine boredom and get a little cardio in while you're at it. So, turn up the music, gather your crew (or dance solo, no shame), and let's get groovin' to these addictive beats! #TikTokDanceQueen #SavageLoveChallenge 💃🕺🔥
