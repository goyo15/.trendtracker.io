# Fake Commute Videos — 2025-12-27

Hey fam, let’s talk about the latest TikTok trend: fake commute videos. 🚗💨 Honestly, I’m living for them. Who knew watching someone pretend to drive to work could be so entertaining? It’s like virtual carpool karaoke without leaving your bed. And don’t even get me started on the fake train rides with scenic views – total vibe, am I right?

But here's the tea: as much as I love these videos, it low-key makes me miss the days of actually commuting. Like, remember blasting music in the car with your friends or people-watching on the train? Those were the days. So, shoutout to all the creators out there bringing a taste of normalcy back into our lives through these fake commute vids. Keep ‘em coming, cause let’s be real, we all need a little escape from our pajama-clad reality once in a while. 🌟 #FakeCommuteGoals #VirtualEscape
