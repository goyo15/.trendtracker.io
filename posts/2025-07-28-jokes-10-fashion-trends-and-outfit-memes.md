# Fashion trends and outfit memes â€” 2025-07-28

But let's be real, not every trend is a hit. I mean, who really wants to wear low-rise jeans again? Let's leave that in the 2000s where it belongs. However, oversized blazers and mini skirts? Yes, please! And can we talk about how chunky platform sneakers are making a major comeback? I'm here for it!
