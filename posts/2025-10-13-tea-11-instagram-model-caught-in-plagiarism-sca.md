# Instagram model caught in plagiarism scandal over copied captions and photos — 2025-10-13

Hey, fam! 📸 Have you heard the latest tea on the ‘gram? 🍵 An Instagram model got exposed for copying captions and photos, and let me tell you, it’s a whole mess. 😱 Like sis, we all know the struggle to come up with the perfect caption, but straight-up copying? 🤦‍♀️ Not cool.

I mean, we’re all about being real and authentic on social media, right? So seeing someone try to pass off someone else’s work as their own is a major 🚫. It’s all about celebrating uniqueness and creativity, not being a copycat. 🐱‍🏍

Let this be a lesson to all of us: stay true to yourself and your own voice. Don’t be out here trying to be someone you’re not, ‘cause the truth always comes out in the end. Keep slaying with your originality and don’t let the fakes dull your shine, y’all. ✨ #BeAuthentic #NoRoomForCopycats
