# Slang and trendy phrases jokes — 2025-12-15

Hey fam! Let’s talk about slang and trendy phrases because, like, can we all just agree that some of them are so cringe-worthy? 🙄 I mean, don’t get me wrong, I love a good vibe check and throwing shade as much as the next person, but can we please retire the whole “I oop” thing? It’s so last season. 

And don’t even get me started on “sksksk” – I literally can’t even with that one. Like, what even is that supposed to mean? 🤷‍♀️ Let’s leave those phrases in 2020 where they belong, okay?

But hey, if you wanna keep it fresh and stay on trend, there are always new phrases popping up that are actually kinda cool. So, let’s all do our part to make sure we’re not out here sounding like total boomers, alright? Stay woke, stay fierce, and keep slaying those slang game, my friends! 💁‍♂️✌️ #StayFresh #NoCap #TrendyAF
