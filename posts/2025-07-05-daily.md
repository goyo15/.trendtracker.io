# Cargo Pants Comeback!

**Trend:** Cargo pants are everywhere â€” TikTokers are rocking them with neon crop tops and chunky sneakers.  
**Style Inspo:** Pair yours with a smiley tee and butterfly clips for that Y2K vibe!

**Joke:** Why did the teen love cargo pants? Because they had more pockets than problems.

**Tea:** Rumor has it that a pop superstar was spotted in cargo pants at the music awards last night. The trend is officially back.
