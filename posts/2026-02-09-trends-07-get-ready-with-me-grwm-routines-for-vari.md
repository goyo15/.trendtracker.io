# Get ready with me (GRWM) routines for various occasions — 2026-02-09

Hey squad, let’s talk GRWM routines for all occasions! Whether you’re heading to a cute date, a wild party, or just a chill hangout with friends, I’ve got you covered.

For a romantic date, start with a soft glam look – think rosy cheeks and a subtle shimmer on the lids. Pair it with a sweet fragrance and a killer outfit to make bae swoon.

If it’s party time, amp up the glam with a bold smokey eye, a poppin’ highlight, and a fierce red lip. Don’t forget to set your look with some setting spray to keep it going all night long.

And for those casual hangouts, keep it simple with a natural makeup look, a cozy outfit, and a fresh, clean scent. Effortlessly chic is the vibe you’re going for.

No matter the occasion, remember to be confident and rock whatever look you choose. Stay slayin’, beauties! 💋✨ #GRWM #SlayAllDay
