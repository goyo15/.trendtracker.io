# Gen Z slang and phrases - incorporating current slang terms and expressions — 2025-08-10

Yo, my fellow Gen Z peeps! Let’s spill the tea on our lit slang and phrases! 😜From saying “sksksk” when something’s funny to calling someone “extra” when they’re over the top, we’ve got a whole vocab that’s straight 🔥. 

Feeling stressed? Just tell your friends you’re “low key vibing” and they’ll know. And when a new bop drops, don’t forget to say “that’s a whole vibe”. And if someone’s looking fly, give ‘em a “snatched” compliment. 💁‍♀️

But remember, our lingo evolves faster than you can say “bruh”. So stay woke, fam, and keep up with the trends. So next time you catch yourself saying “periodt” instead of “yes”, know you’re totally on fleek. Stay trendy, stay bold, and keep slaying the game. Peace out! ✌️ #GenZspeak #SlayingTheSlang
