# Social media challenges and viral trends — 2026-02-22

Yo, what’s up my fellow teens! Let’s talk about social media challenges and viral trends - the good, the bad, and the straight-up ridiculous. From the Ice Bucket Challenge to the famous Mannequin Challenge, these trends can spread like wildfire across our feeds. But let me tell you, they can be a double-edged sword. 

While some challenges raise awareness for important causes and bring people together, others can be downright dangerous and promote harmful behaviors. Remember the Tide Pod Challenge? Yeah, let’s not go there. It’s crucial to use our platforms for positivity and not just for likes and follows.

So, next time you see a challenge or trend going viral, think before you jump on the bandwagon. Is it promoting something positive or just seeking attention? Let’s be smart about what we share and make sure we’re using our influence for good. Stay trendy, stay safe, and keep slaying those social media game, fam! ✌️ #StayWoke #ThinkBeforeYouTrend
