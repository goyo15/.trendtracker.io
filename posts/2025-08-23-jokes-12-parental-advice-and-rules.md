# Parental Advice and Rules — 2025-08-23

Hey fam! Let’s talk about parental advice and rules – ugh, the struggle is real, am I right? 😫 It’s like they’re always trying to rain on our parade with their “wisdom” and “guidelines”. But hey, deep down, we know they mean well (kinda). 

Sure, they might be annoying with all their “be home by 10 pm” and “don’t talk to strangers” talk, but let’s face it, they’ve been around the block a few times. I guess we gotta give ‘em props for caring enough to dish out those unwanted nuggets of wisdom. 

And hey, sometimes their rules actually make sense (shocking, I know). So next time they start with the “I’m your parent, not your friend” stuff, maybe just nod, smile, and silently roll your eyes. Because let’s be real, we’d probably be lost without their pesky interference. Love ‘em or hate ‘em, parents really do know best (or at least they think they do). 🙄💁‍♀️✨ #ParentalGuidanceSuggested
