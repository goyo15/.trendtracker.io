# Behind-the-scenes gossip from popular TV shows or movies — 2025-09-23

Hey, fam! Let’s spill the tea on all the juiciest behind-the-scenes gossip from our fave TV shows and movies. 🎬 Did y’all know that the cast of Riverdale is legit BFFs off-screen too? Major squad goals! And get this – apparently, the Stranger Things kids have a secret handshake that they do before every scene. Can you say adorbs? 😍

But wait, there’s more! Rumor has it that during filming of The Kissing Booth, Joey King and Jacob Elordi’s on-screen romance may have turned into a real-life love story. Swoon-worthy, am I right? And don’t even get me started on the epic prank wars that go down on set of Avengers. Chris Evans is the king of pranks – must be all that Captain America training! 🦸‍♂️

So there you have it, my fellow entertainment junkies. Keep your eyes peeled for more gossip ‘cause Hollywood’s always serving up the drama, on and off camera! 💋✨ #LightsCameraDrama
