# Scandals involving popular YouTubers or streamers — 2025-09-14

Hey fam, can we talk about these scandals involving our fave YouTubers and streamers? Like, seriously, it’s getting out of hand. From shady sponsorship deals to inappropriate behavior, it feels like every other day someone we looked up to is embroiled in some drama.

I mean, we get it, no one’s perfect, but come on, can they at least try to be decent human beings? It’s not cool to disappoint your fans like that. And don’t even get me started on the excuses and apologies that sound more like excuses than apologies.

Let’s hold these influencers accountable, demand transparency, and support creators who actually deserve our admiration. Because at the end of the day, we deserve better role models than these problematic personalities. Keep it real, stay woke, and remember, you don’t have to stan someone who doesn’t stan you back. Peace out.
