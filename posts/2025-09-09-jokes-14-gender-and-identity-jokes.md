# Gender and identity jokes — 2025-09-09

Hey fam! Let’s chat about gender and identity jokes – the good, the bad, and the downright cringeworthy. 🙅‍♀️ It’s cool to joke around and have a laugh, but when those jokes start targeting someone’s gender or identity, it’s a hard pass from me.

Using gender or identity as the punchline of a joke just isn’t funny – it can be hurtful and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. Let’s keep it real, being inclusive and respecting each other’s identities is where the true humor lies!

Next time someone cracks a joke that doesn’t sit right with you, speak up! 🗣️ Let them know that it’s not cool and educate them on why those jokes just don’t fly. Remember, it’s all about spreading positivity and kindness, and that never goes out of style. Keep shining bright, fam! ✨ #SpreadPositivity #RespectAllIdentities
