# Social media jokes — 2025-10-18

Hey fam, let’s talk about social media jokes - the memes, the roasts, and the savagery that we live for. I mean, where else can we find hilarious content on the daily? Whether it’s a trending TikTok challenge or a perfectly timed tweet, social media is the gift that keeps on giving.

But let’s be real, not all jokes land the same. Some are fire, others are just meh. And don’t even get me started on the cringeworthy ones that make you question people’s sense of humor. Like, seriously, who still finds “What do you call cheese that isn’t yours? Nacho cheese!” funny in 2021?

So, let’s keep the laughter coming but also remember to elevate our meme game. Let’s support original creators, spread positivity, and above all, never be afraid to laugh at ourselves. Because in this crazy digital world, a good meme can make all the difference. Stay laughing, stay woke, and keep those social media jokes coming! #MemeTeam 🤪✌️
