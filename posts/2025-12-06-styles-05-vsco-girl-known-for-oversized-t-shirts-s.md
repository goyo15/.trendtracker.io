Hey, fam! Let’s talk about the iconic VSCO girl trend that’s taking over our feeds! 🌊🌸 Rocking oversized tees, scrunchies for days, Birkenstocks, and that chill beachy vibe, these girls are all about that laid-back and carefree lifestyle. From sipping on Hydro Flasks to saving the turtles with their reusable metal straws, VSCO girls are all about that eco-friendly game. 🐢✨ And let’s not forget their love for capturing those artsy, sun-kissed photos with the VSCO app – those filters make everything look Insta-worthy! Who needs a glam squad when you have a messy bun and a shell necklace, am I right? So, grab your reusable water bottle, slap on your fav scrunchie, and let’s vibe with the VSCO girl aesthetic – because saving the planet never looked so cute! 🌎💖 #VSCOgirl #Sksksk #SaveTheTurtles
