# Dance trends (e.g., Renegade, Say So) — 2025-08-01

Hey, fam! Let’s groove into the world of dance trends because, let’s face it, TikTok is ruling our lives with its catchy beats and funky moves. From the Renegade to Say So, these trends are taking over the dance floor faster than you can say “twirl”.

The Renegade, with its intricate arm movements and fast pace, is a challenge even for the most seasoned dancers. But once you nail it, you feel like a total boss babe ready to conquer the world. And don’t even get me started on Say So - that dance is pure sass and confidence, and every time I bust out those moves, I feel like a legit pop star.

So, whether you’re a dance pro or just love to bust a move in your bedroom, these trends are bringing us all together in a virtual dance party like no other. Let’s keep shimmying, shaking, and slaying those TikTok challenges, because why not? Dance like nobody’s watching, okay, maybe just the whole internet. 💃🕺✨ #DanceTrends #TikTokFamous #FlossinIt
