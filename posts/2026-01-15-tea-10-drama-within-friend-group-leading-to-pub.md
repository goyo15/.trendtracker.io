# Drama within friend group leading to public arguments on Twitter — 2026-01-15

Hey, fam! Let’s talk about drama within friend groups spilling onto Twitter! 💥🔥 We all know how messy things can get when private drama goes public, right? But it’s 2021, peeps! Let’s keep the tea 👀 in our group chats and off our timelines, mkay? Public arguments on Twitter might get you the likes and retweets, but at what cost? Trust me, a good old face-to-face convo beats a Twitter war any day! Remember, not everything needs to be posted for the world to see. Let’s keep it classy, keep it real, and most importantly, keep our drama out of the public eye! So next time things start heating up in your friend group, take a breath, step away from the keyboard, and handle it like the boss you are! 🔥✌️ #NoTwitterDrama #KeepItPrivate
