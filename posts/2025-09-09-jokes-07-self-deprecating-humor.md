# Self-deprecating humor — 2025-09-09

Hey there, fam! Let’s chat about self-deprecating humor – the OG form of comedy that seems to be taking over social media these days. Sure, making fun of ourselves can be kinda funny and relatable, but where do we draw the line between joking and actually bringing ourselves down? 🤔

I get it, we all have our flaws and making light of them can sometimes be a coping mechanism. But y’all, we’re all boss babes and kings in our own right, so let’s not forget to lift ourselves up while we’re cracking jokes. Let’s sprinkle in some self-love along with those self-deprecating punchlines, okay?

Remember, it’s cool to laugh at yourself, but it’s even cooler to embrace and celebrate who you are. So, keep the humor light, the vibes positive, and remember that you’re worth more than just a quick laugh. Stay fabulous, darlings! 💁‍♀️✨ #selflove #positivityiskey
