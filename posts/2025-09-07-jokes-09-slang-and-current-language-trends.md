# Slang and current language trends — 2025-09-07

Hey squad, let’s talk about slang and current language trends - because language is lit and constantly evolving! 💬 From “basic” to “savage” to “yeet”, new slang words pop up all the time and spread like wildfire. It’s like, a whole new language out there, fam! 🙌 But remember, not all slang is Gucci - sometimes it can be cringy or just straight-up confusing. Like, who even came up with “stan” or “flex”? 🤷‍♀️ We may not always understand the latest terms, but that’s what Urban Dictionary is for, amirite? 😂 The key is to stay woke and keep up with the trends. So next time you hear a new word or phrase, don’t be a boomer - embrace it and add it to your vocab. Language is constantly evolving, and we’re all in this together. Stay slayin’, my peeps! 💁‍♂️🔥 #LanguageGameStrong #TeensRockingTheVernacular
