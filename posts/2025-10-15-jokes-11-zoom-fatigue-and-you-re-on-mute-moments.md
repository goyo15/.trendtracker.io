# Zoom fatigue and "You're on mute" moments — 2025-10-15

Hey fellow Zoomers! Let’s chat about the struggle that has become all too real - Zoom fatigue and those dreaded “You’re on mute” moments. 🙄 As if virtual classes and meetings weren’t draining enough, now we have to deal with the constant reminder that our tech just loves to remind us we’ve been silenced. Thanks a lot, mute button.

I mean, there’s only so many virtual backgrounds, awkward silences, and glitchy Wi-Fi connections a person can take before losing their mind, am I right? And don’t even get me started on the hours spent staring at screens until our eyes feel like they’re gonna pop out of our heads. Can we just fast forward to the part where we can go back to hanging out in person without having to worry about muting or unmuting ourselves every two seconds?

So, here’s to all of us trying to survive the virtual world one “You’re on mute” moment at a time. Hang in there, we’ll get through this... eventually. Stay sassy, Zoomers! 😉 #ZoomFatigue #YoureOnMute #VirtualStruggles
