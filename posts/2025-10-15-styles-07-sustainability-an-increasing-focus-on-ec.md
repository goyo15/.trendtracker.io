# Sustainability - An increasing focus on eco-friendly and ethical fashion choices among teens. — 2025-10-15

Hey fam! Let's talk about sustainability – the latest buzzword in the fashion world! 🌿🌍 As a teen, it's totally rad to see more of us shifting towards eco-friendly and ethical fashion choices. It's like, no one wants to look cute if it means hurting the planet or supporting unfair labor practices, right?

From rocking vintage finds to shopping from sustainable brands and upcycling old clothes, us teens are making moves towards a greener wardrobe. And let me tell you, it's not just about looking good; it's about feeling good too. Knowing that our outfit choices aren’t harming the environment or exploiting workers gives us major style AND moral points.

So, next time you're scrolling through your favorite online store, think twice about where your clothes are coming from. Do a little research, support brands that care about the planet, and show the world that fashion can be both fly and eco-friendly! Let's slay sustainably, babes! 💚✨ #GreenIsTheNewBlack
