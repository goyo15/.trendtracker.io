# Music and song parody humor — 2025-11-21

Hey babes, let’s talk about music and song parody humor! 🎶💁‍♀️ There’s nothing like a good parody to put a fresh spin on your fave tunes and make you laugh out loud. From Weird Al Yankovic to The Lonely Island, these artists know how to turn hits into hilarious masterpieces.

Whether it’s poking fun at pop culture trends or just making fun of ourselves, song parodies always hit the spot. Remember when “Call Me Maybe” became “Call Me Mabye” or “All About That Bass” turned into “All About That Change”? Classic humor, amirite?

And let’s not forget the TikTok trend of rewriting lyrics to fit current events or memes. Honestly, it’s the ultimate form of self-expression and creativity. So next time you find yourself jamming out to a bop, why not try your hand at crafting your very own parody? Who knows, you might just be the next viral sensation! Keep it snappy, keep it sassy, and most importantly, keep the humor alive, babes! 💅✨ #ParodyPower #MusicalLaughs
