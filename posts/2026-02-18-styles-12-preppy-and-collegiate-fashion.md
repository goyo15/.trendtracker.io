# Preppy and collegiate fashion — 2026-02-18

Hey there, fashionistas! Let’s talk preppy and collegiate style – the epitome of chic and classy vibes. Think blazers, plaid skirts, loafers, and, of course, a touch of sophistication.

I’m obsessed with how this trend effortlessly combines preppy elements with a modern twist. Layer a crisp white button-down under a crewneck sweater or pair a pleated skirt with a graphic tee for a fun, unexpected look.

Accessories are key when it comes to achieving that collegiate cool-girl vibe. Toss on a pair of statement earrings or a sleek watch to elevate your outfit to new levels of sophistication.

So, whether you’re hitting the books or hanging out with friends, embrace your inner Blair Waldorf and rock that preppy and collegiate fashion with confidence. Stay stylish, babes! 💁🏻‍♀️📚👗🎓 #PrepStyle #CollegiateChic
