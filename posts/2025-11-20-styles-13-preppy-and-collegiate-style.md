# Preppy and collegiate style — 2025-11-20

Hey, trendsetters! Let’s talk about preppy and collegiate style – the tried and true look that never goes out of fashion. Think crisp button-downs, pleated skirts, and classic blazers. Whether you’re hitting the books or heading to a coffee date, this vibe exudes sophistication and smarts. 

Mixing and matching patterns like plaid and stripes adds a fun twist, while accessorizing with pearls or a cute pair of loafers instantly elevates your outfit. Don’t forget the essentials like a polished watch or a monogrammed tote bag to complete the look.

Embrace your inner Blair Waldorf or Rory Gilmore and rock that preppy-chic aesthetic with confidence. It’s all about showing off your signature style and embracing the power of a put-together ensemble. So, grab your favorite cardigan and channel those Ivy League vibes wherever you go. Stay classy, darling!
