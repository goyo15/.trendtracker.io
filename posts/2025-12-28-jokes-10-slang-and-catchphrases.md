# Slang and Catchphrases — 2025-12-28

Hey, fam! Let’s chat about slang and catchphrases—because let’s be real, they make our convos poppin’! From “sksksk” to “yeet” to “on fleek”, our generation is constantly coming up with new ways to spice up our language. It’s like our very own secret code that sets us apart from the boring adults, am I right?

But here’s the tea: as much as we love throwing around these lit phrases, it’s important to remember that they can also shape how others perceive us. So, let’s stay woke and use our words wisely. Let’s keep it 100 and not go overboard with the slang, or we might sound like we’re tryna be something we’re not.

So, next time you drop a “savage” or “stan”, remember to keep it authentic and true to who you are. Because at the end of the day, our words hold power—let’s make sure we use it for good. Stay slayin’, my peeps! ✌️ #KeepItReal #SlangSlayer
