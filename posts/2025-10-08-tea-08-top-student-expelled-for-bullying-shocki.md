# Top student expelled for bullying, shocking classmates and teachers. — 2025-10-08

Hey, fam! 😱 Can you believe the latest drama at our school? The top student, you know, the one who always had their hand up in class and aced every test, just got expelled for bullying! 🙅🏽‍♀️ It’s got everyone shook – from the teachers to the students. Like, how could someone so smart be so mean? 💔

But you know what? It’s a wake-up call that anyone, no matter how popular or successful, can be capable of hurtful behavior. We need to stand up against bullying and create a supportive environment for everyone. Let’s be the change we want to see in our school, spread kindness like confetti, and show that being a top student goes beyond just grades – it’s about being a decent human being. ✨

So, let’s keep our heads high, support those who need it, and remember that true success is measured by how we treat others. Stay woke, stay kind, and let’s make our school a better place for all. 🙌🏼 #NoBullyingZone #KindnessMatters
