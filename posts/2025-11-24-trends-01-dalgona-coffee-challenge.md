# Dalgona coffee challenge — 2025-11-24

Hey, fam! Who else has tried the Dalgona coffee challenge taking the internet by storm? This whipped treat is giving regular old coffee a major glow-up and I am HERE for it. It’s all about that frothy, Instagram-worthy goodness on top of your java. 

But let me tell you, folks, this TikTok trend is no joke. Getting that perfect froth requires some serious arm muscles. My biceps are definitely feeling the burn after attempting this a few times. Pro tip: an electric whisk might just be your new best friend for this challenge.

And the best part? You can totally customize this drink with your fave flavors and milk alternatives. So whether you’re a coffee purist or you like to get creative with your concoctions, the Dalgona coffee challenge is definitely worth a shot. Get frothy and tag me in your pics, I wanna see your coffee game! ☕✨ #DalgonaChallenge #WhipItGood
