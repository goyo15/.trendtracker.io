# VSCO girl vs. E-girl debate taking over Instagram comments — 2025-08-09

Hey guys, have you noticed the VSCO girl vs. E-girl debate blowing up in Instagram comments lately? It feels like everyone’s picking sides faster than you can say “hydro flask” or “chain choker.” 

On one side, you’ve got the VSCO girls with their oversized shirts, scrunchies, and love for saving the turtles. They’re all about that laid-back, beachy vibe and making sure their filter game is on point.

And then you’ve got the E-girls, with their edgy makeup, fishnet stockings, and dark aesthetic. They’re rocking that alt look and aren’t afraid to show off their unique style.

Honestly, I don’t get why we have to choose between one or the other. Can’t we just appreciate both styles for what they are? Let’s embrace the differences, support each other's self-expression, and remember that fashion is all about having fun and feeling confident in your own skin. So whether you're a VSCO girl, an E-girl, or somewhere in between, just do you, boo. #LiveYourBestLife 💁‍♀️🖤🌊
