Hey, cool cats and kittens! Let’s talk about school and distance learning jokes that are giving us some major LOL moments during these crazy times. From Zoom mishaps to virtual backgrounds gone wrong, there’s no shortage of comedic gold happening in our online classrooms.

Who else has accidentally unmuted themselves and dropped some serious commentary while the teacher was talking? 🙋‍♀️ Or how about when you hear someone’s mom yelling in the background to pick up your room while attempting to solve a math problem? Classic.

And let’s not forget the struggle of trying to keep up with assignments while simultaneously fending off the urge to nap during class. Can someone please invent an app that detects when we’re falling asleep and launches a virtual alarm clock in our faces?
