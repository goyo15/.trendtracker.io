# Cottagecore and farmcore styles — 2025-10-25

Hey, fellow trendsetters! Let’s talk cottagecore and farmcore – two styles straight out of a fairy tale! 🌿🐑

Cottagecore is all about embracing cozy, rustic vibes with flowy dresses, vintage florals, and lots of lace. Think picnics in the countryside and baking homemade goodies in a quaint little kitchen. It’s like living in your own Pinterest board!

On the flip side, farmcore is all about that practical, hardworking aesthetic. Think overalls, plaid shirts, and rubber boots – perfect for getting down and dirty in the garden or helping out on the farm. Channel your inner farmer chic!

Whether you’re dreaming of a cottage in the woods or fantasizing about tending to crops in the fields, these styles are all about embracing simplicity, nature, and a touch of whimsy. So, grab your sun hat and get ready to channel your inner cottagecore/farmcore vibe! 🌻🐓 #FashionInspo #Cottagecore #Farmcore
