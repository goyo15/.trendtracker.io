# Self-deprecating humor — 2025-07-09

Hey fellow teens, let’s spill some tea about self-deprecating humor! 🍵 Sure, it can be funny to poke fun at ourselves, but let’s not get caught in a whirlpool of negative vibes. Self-deprecating jokes can be like a sprinkle of salt on our self-esteem fries – a little can enhance the flavor, but too much leaves a bitter taste. We’re all fabulous in our own unique ways, so let’s not dim our glow for the sake of a quick laugh. Instead, let’s serve up some self-love and empower each other to shine bright like the stars we are. So, next time you’re tempted to crack a self-deprecating joke, pause and remember: you’re amazing just the way you are. Keep it real, keep it sassy, and always remember, you’re worth more than any punchline! 💁‍♀️💅 #SelfLoveClub #OwnYourAwesomeness
