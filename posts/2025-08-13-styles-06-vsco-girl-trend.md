# VSCO girl trend — 2025-08-13

Guys, let’s talk about the VSCO girl trend that’s taking over our feeds! From scrunchies to Hydro Flasks, this trend is all about living that eco-friendly, laid-back lifestyle. But let’s be real, are we really all willing to drop major cash on a metal straw just to save the turtles? 🐢 And don’t get me started on the “sksksk” and “and I oop” catchphrases - are we just hopping on the bandwagon? Despite the eye-rolling, there’s something kinda cool about embracing minimalism and caring for the planet, am I right? It’s a vibe that’s all about being unapologetically basic and having fun with it. So go ahead, rock those oversized t-shirts, shell necklaces, and messy buns, and let your inner VSCO girl shine! Just remember, it’s all about being genuine and not just following trends for the ‘gram. #InfluencerLife #VSCOgirls ✌️💕
