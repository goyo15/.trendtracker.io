# Relationships and crushes — 2026-01-16

Hey, fam! Let’s spill some tea on relationships and crushes because, let’s be real, we’ve all been there. Crushes? They hit us like a ton of bricks, right? Those heart-fluttering feels can be intense, but here’s the deal - don’t let them define your worth! Relationships? They’re all about mutual respect, communication, and trust. If they don’t lift you up and make you smile, they ain’t it, sis. Remember, YOU are the prize, not some crush or relationship. Bottom line - love yourself first, slay your goals, and the right person will come along when the time is right. So keep your head high, your standards higher, and always trust your gut. Stay fierce, stay fabulous, and remember, you got this! 💖✨ #RelationshipRealness #CrushingIt #LoveYourself
