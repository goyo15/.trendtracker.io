# Social media and technology jokes — 2025-08-15

Hey, squad! Let’s talk about social media and tech jokes - because let’s be real, we all love a good meme or two. From roasting Instagram influencers to poking fun at our internet addictions, these jokes keep us scrolling and LOLing all day long. 

Who else can relate to FaceTiming their friend who’s literally sitting right next to them? 🤳 Or how about when autocorrect changes “chill” to “chicken”? 🍗 And don’t even get me started on those text messages that are so dry, you need a glass of water just to reply. 💧

But hey, whether it’s TikTok trends or viral tweets, these jokes bring us together in a virtual world filled with laughter and relatability. So cheers to all the tech-savvy comedians out there keeping our feeds light and our spirits high! Stay connected, stay laughing, and above all, stay sippin’ that ☕️! #TechHumor #SocialMediaLaughs 📱😂✨
