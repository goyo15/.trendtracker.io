# School and homework jokes — 2025-11-25

Hey squad, let’s talk about the ultimate survival tactic for getting through school - humor. School and homework jokes are like the secret weapon in our arsenal, am I right? Because let’s face it, sometimes you just gotta laugh to keep from crying when you’re drowning in assignments and exams. 

When that math problem looks like hieroglyphics and your brain’s on the fritz, a well-timed school joke can turn your whole day around. And don’t even get me started on group projects - the struggle is real, but a good joke can make the chaos a little more bearable.

So keep those puns and memes coming, because laughter is the best study buddy we could ask for. Let’s take on the school year one hilarious joke at a time, and remember, it’s all fun and games until someone asks if you’ve started your homework. Keep slaying, my fellow students! #SchoolJokesForDays
