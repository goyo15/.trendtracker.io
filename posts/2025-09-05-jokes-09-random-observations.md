# Random observations — 2025-09-05

Hey y’all, it’s your girl with some random observations that’ll make you go, “yep, that’s totally true!” First up, have you noticed how people with the messiest rooms always claim to have their life together? Like, seriously, if you can’t find your phone in that jungle of clothes, I highly doubt you’ve got it all figured out.

And let’s talk about those people who wear sunglasses indoors. Do they think they’re too cool for regular lighting? I mean, we get it, you’re trying to look like a celebrity, but come on, it’s just not a good look.

Lastly, have you ever realized that the best conversations happen late at night? It’s like there’s something magical about the darkness that makes us spill all our secrets and thoughts. So next time you’re up past midnight, grab a friend and get ready for some deep talks.

Stay woke, stay sassy, and keep on observing the randomness of this world!✌️ #randomobservations #StaySassy
