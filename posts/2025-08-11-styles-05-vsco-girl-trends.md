# VSCO girl trends — 2025-08-11

Hey y'all, let's talk VSCO girl trends! 🌿🌊 From oversized scrunchies to metal straws, these laid-back girls are all about that eco-friendly vibe. It's all about being carefree, hanging out at the beach, and rocking those Birkenstocks like nobody's business. And of course, we can't forget the iconic Hydro Flask - gotta stay hydrated in style, am I right? 😎🚰 

But let's be real, being a VSCO girl isn't just about the accessories - it's a whole lifestyle. It's about spreading positivity, being kind to the planet, and embracing that natural beauty. So next time you see someone rocking a shell necklace or saying "sksksk and I oop", give 'em a high five for keeping it real. Let's keep the VSCO girl vibes going strong! 💖🐢 #savetheturtles #vsco #stayhydrated
