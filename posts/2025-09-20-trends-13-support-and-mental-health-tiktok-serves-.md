We all know that Gen Z places a high value on being real and raw, and TikTok delivers just that when it comes to mental health discussions. It's refreshing to see creators and users sharing their highs and lows, reminding us that it's okay not to be okay sometimes. So next time you're scrolling through TikTok, remember to seek out those voices that uplift and inspire you.
