# Promposal gone wrong in a public setting, causing embarrassment — 2025-08-20

OMG, y’all won’t believe the drama I witnessed yesterday! Picture this: crowded cafeteria, everyone minding their business, and then BAM – a promposal gone totally wrong. 🤦‍♀️ Props to the guy for putting himself out there, but things took a cringy turn real quick. He got down on one knee, pulled out a bouquet, and asked his crush to prom... only to find out she was already going with someone else! 👀 The whole place went silent as he stood there, bouquet wilting in hand, face turning redder by the second. 💔 It was like a scene straight out of a teen rom-com, but let’s just say there were no sparks flying. The level of secondhand embarrassment was off the charts. Lesson learned: always do your recon before making a grand gesture, unless you’re aiming for a front-row seat to the ultimate facepalm moment. 😬 #PromFail #AwkwardEncounters
