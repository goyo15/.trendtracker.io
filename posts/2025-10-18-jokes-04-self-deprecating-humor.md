# Self-deprecating humor — 2025-10-18

Hey there, squad! Let's talk about self-deprecating humor – you know, when we roast ourselves for a good laugh. It can be all fun and games, but we gotta remember not to cross the line, right? It’s cool to joke about our quirks and mishaps, but constantly putting ourselves down ain’t a vibe. Self-love is the move, peeps!

Sure, poking fun at ourselves can bond us with others and show we don’t take ourselves too seriously. But let’s keep it positive and uplifting, yeah? There’s a thin line between humor and harm, so let's be mindful of our words and how they affect us and our crew. So, shine on, fam! Embrace your fabulous flaws and spread good vibes – that’s the real tea. Stay sassy and authentic, and remember, self-love always slays! #StayHumbleStayFabulous 💁‍♀️🔥✨
