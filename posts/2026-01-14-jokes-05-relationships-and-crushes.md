# Relationships and Crushes — 2026-01-14

Hey all you cool cats and kittens! Today, let’s spill the tea on relationships and crushes 🍵💕. We’ve all been there – heart eyes for that special someone who makes your heart race faster than a TikTok trend.

But here’s the real deal: crushes can be exciting, but relationships take werk, werk, werk. It’s all about communication, trust, and respect. So don’t just slide into those DMs without thinking twice, sis!

And remember, it’s 2021 – ghosting is so last season. If someone’s not feeling it, respect their feelings and move on like the boss babe you are. Your worth isn’t defined by someone else’s validation.

So whether you’re riding the relationship rollercoaster or just crushing from afar, always remember: you’re fabulous, fierce, and totally slaying the game. Stay true to yourself, and don’t settle for anything less than butterflies in your stomach and a smile on your face. You got this, bb’s! 💖 #RelationshipGoals #CrushinIt
