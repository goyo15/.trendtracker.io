Hey, fellow teens! Let's talk about the VSCO girl trend taking over our feeds. Influenced by the chill vibes of the VSCO app culture, this style is all about oversized tees, scrunchies, Birkenstocks, and metal straws. It's all about that laid-back, environmentally-conscious aesthetic.

Rocking the VSCO girl look means being unapologetically casual yet stylish. Want to join the tribe? Just grab your Hydro Flask, pile on those bracelets, and top it off with some beachy waves. Oh, and don't forget the classic "sksksk" and "and I oop" phrases!

Whether you're already a VSCO girl or just curious about the trend, there's no denying the impact it's had on fashion and sustainability. So, let's embrace our inner VSCO girl, save the turtles, and spread those good vibes. And remember – it's not just a look, it's a lifestyle! Stay trendy, friends! ✌️🌿 #VSCOGirl #SaveTheTurtles
