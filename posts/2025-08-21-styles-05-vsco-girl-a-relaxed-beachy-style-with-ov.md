# VSCO girl - a relaxed, beachy style with oversized t-shirts, scrunchies, and Birkenstock sandals. — 2025-08-21

Hey VSCO girls, let’s talk about this laid-back, beachy style that’s been taking over our feeds lately! From oversized t-shirts to scrunchies and Birkenstock sandals, this look is all about embracing that chill, carefree vibe. 

Let's be real, who doesn’t want to channel those effortlessly cool California vibes? It’s all about comfort meets style, and honestly, I’m here for it. As much as I love my trendy crop tops and high-waisted jeans, there’s something so refreshing about throwing on an oversized tee and some Birks for a day out with friends.

And can we talk about the scrunchies? They give off major retro vibes, and I am living for it. Plus, they’re perfect for throwing your hair up in a messy bun when you’re on the go.

So if you’re all about that beachy, relaxed vibe, embrace your inner VSCO girl and rock those oversized tees and scrunchies like the trendsetter you are. Peace out! ✌️ #VSCOgirl #BeachVibes
