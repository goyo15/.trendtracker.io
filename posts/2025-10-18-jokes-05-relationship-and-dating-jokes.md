# Relationship and dating jokes — 2025-10-18

Hey, squad! Let's talk about relationship and dating jokes that make us LOL and roll our eyes at the same time. We've all heard those cheesy pick-up lines and cringe-worthy puns, but you know what? They low-key make us chuckle.

Picture this: you're on a coffee date and your crush says, "Are you religious? Because you're the answer to all my prayers." Classic, right? It's so bad, it's good!

And who can forget the classic dad joke level of "Are you a parking ticket? Because you've got 'FINE' written all over you." I mean, 10 points for effort, right?

Whether it's poking fun at the ups and downs of dating or just trying to break the ice, relationship jokes always have a special place in our hearts. So next time someone hits you with a corny line, just remember to smile and appreciate the effort – even if you're secretly rolling your eyes. Stay sassy, squad! 💋✌️
