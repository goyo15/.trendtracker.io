# Friendship dynamics — 2025-09-24

Hey fam, let’s spill the tea on friendship dynamics! 🍵✨ We all know friendships can be a rollercoaster, am I right? From the drama to the laughs, it's a whole vibe. But sometimes, those dynamics can get kinda messy. Are you the one always initiating plans or the go-to for advice? It's all fun and games until you realize it's a one-way street.

But listen up, queen bees, friendship should be a two-way street. Don't be afraid to set boundaries and speak up if things feel off. True friends will respect your feelings and make an effort to balance the friendship equation. Remember, it's totally okay to outgrow friendships or drift apart - it's just part of adulting, my loves.

So, surround yourself with people who lift you up and bring positive energy to your squad. Real recognize real, and your vibe attracts your tribe. Stay fierce, stay fabulous, and keep those friendship dynamics in check, babes! 💁‍♀️💖 #FriendshipGoals
