# VSCO girl/boy style — 2026-02-19

Alright my fellow teens, let’s talk about the VSCO girl/boy style trend that’s taking over the internet lately. From oversized t-shirts, scrunchies, and Hydro Flasks to Birkenstocks and shell necklaces, it seems like everyone is jumping on the VSCO train.

But let’s be real, this trend is more than just a fashion statement. It’s all about that laid-back, carefree vibe and embracing your natural beauty. Who wouldn’t want to rock a messy bun, bare face, and effortlessly cool outfit every day?

Sure, some might call it basic, but I say it’s all about confidence and comfort. So whether you’re a VSCO girl, VSCO boy, or just someone who appreciates a good scrunchie and beachy waves, don’t be afraid to rock that laid-back style with pride. After all, being yourself is always on trend. #VSCOvibes #StayChill✌️🌊
