# Gen Z slang and acronyms — 2025-07-23

Hey squad! Let’s spill the tea on Gen Z slang and acronyms that are LIT right now. 💁‍♀️

First up, we’ve got “TBH” (to be honest), which is perfect for when you wanna keep it real with your besties. And let’s not forget “AF” (as f***), because sometimes regular old “very” just won’t cut it.

Feeling totally fed-up with something? Time to hit ‘em with a “SMH” (shaking my head) or even a “DNF” (do not friend). And if you’re crushing hard on someone, just drop a “SOS” (send help) and hope they get the hint.

With all these abbrevs and slang flying around, it’s like we’ve got our own secret language. So, stay woke and keep slinging those slang terms like a boss. Stay fresh, stay rad, and keep on slaying, my friends! 😜🔥 #GenZ #SlangGoals
