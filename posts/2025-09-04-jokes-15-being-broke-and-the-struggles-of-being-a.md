# Being broke and the struggles of being a teen — 2025-09-04

Yo, fam, let’s keep it real for a sec. Being a broke teen is basically a rite of passage. It’s like, you wanna hang with your squad, hit up the coolest spots, and cop the latest fits…but your bank account is over here looking like a deserted wasteland.

I’m talking about the struggle of having to budget every single penny, saying “no” to things you really want, and feeling major FOMO when your friends are living their best lives while you’re stuck at home Netflix and chilling (literally, because who can afford to go out these days?).

But hey, we’re in this together. Let’s hustle, get creative with our side hustles, and grind our way to that financial freedom. And when we finally make it big, we’ll look back on these days and laugh, knowing we came out on top. Stay strong, broke teens, we got this 💪🏼💸 #BrokeButStillBoujee
