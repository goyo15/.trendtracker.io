# Relationship and dating humor — 2025-09-07

Hey fellow teens! Let’s talk about relationship and dating humor - because let’s face it, sometimes you just have to laugh to keep from crying! 

Ever been on a date where the person orders for you? Awkward, right? I mean, we can choose our own entrees, thanks! And don’t even get me started on those cringy pickup lines. “Are you a bank loan? Because you have my interest!” Ugh, pass!

But hey, it’s not all bad! Finding someone who can make you laugh is like finding a rare gem. Sharing inside jokes, goofy moments, and making fun of each other in a loving way - now that’s real #relationshipgoals.

So next time your crush does something silly, instead of facepalming, try laughing it off. After all, life’s too short to take everything so seriously. And remember, the best relationships are the ones where you can be yourself, laugh together, and never run out of memes to share! Stay funny, stay flirty!✌️💕 #datinghumor
