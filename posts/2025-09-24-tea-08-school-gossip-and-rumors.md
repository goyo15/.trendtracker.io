# School gossip and rumors — 2025-09-24

Hey fam, let’s spill the tea on school gossip and rumors! 😬 It’s like a never-ending game of telephone where the facts get twisted and turned into juicy drama. Who said what about who, who’s dating who, and who did what at that party last weekend? 🤔

But hold up, peeps! Before you believe everything you hear, remember that gossip can be super toxic. It can hurt friendships, spread lies, and cause major drama. Plus, it’s just not a good look to be caught up in all that negativity, y’know?

So next time you hear some hot tea being spilled, think twice before sipping on it. Let’s keep it real, stay classy, and spread positivity instead of rumors. After all, high school is too lit for all that drama! 💁‍♀️💅 #NoMoreGossip #StayPositive
