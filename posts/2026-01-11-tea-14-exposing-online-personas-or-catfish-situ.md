# Exposing online personas or “catfish” situations — 2026-01-11

Hey fam, let’s spill the tea on catfishin’ and online personas, ‘cause it’s a whole new world out there. We’ve all seen the Netflix documentaries and heard the horror stories, but let’s chat about how to spot these fake profiles before they reel you in.

First off, trust your gut. If something feels off or too good to be true, it probably is. Remember, Photoshop and filters can work wonders, so don’t fall for the picture-perfect profiles.

Next, do your homework. Google their name, check their social media, and if you’re still not convinced, ask for a video call. Ain’t nobody got time for mysterious avatars.

And lastly, don’t be afraid to call them out. It’s brave to expose the fakes and protect yourself and others from getting catfished.

Stay woke, stay safe, and keep it real in the cyber world.✌️ #CatfishAlert #OnlineSafety
