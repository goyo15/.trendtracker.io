# VSCO girl and e-boy humor — 2025-12-18

Alright, let's spill some tea on VSCO girl and e-boy humor. 🍵 These two trends are taking over the internet faster than you can say "sksksk." From scrunchies to E-girl makeup, it's clear that VSCO girls and e-boys have their own unique sense of style and humor too. 

VSCO girls are all about Hydro Flasks, Fjällräven Kånken backpacks, and saying "and I oop" at every opportunity. Their humor is laid-back, with a sprinkle of self-awareness that makes them totally relatable. Meanwhile, e-boys are rocking chains, painted nails, and often have a serious brooding vibe going on. Their humor is dark, edgy, and filled with a hint of existential crisis – but hey, that's part of the charm, right?

Whether you're a VSCO girl or an e-boy at heart, one thing's for sure: these memes and jokes are bringing us all together in laughter and creating a space for some seriously iconic humor. So grab your oversized sweatshirt, cue the Billie Eilish tunes, and let's all just vibe together in meme heaven. 🌟 #VSCOgirl #eboy #memequeen
