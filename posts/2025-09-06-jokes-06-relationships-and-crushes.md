# Relationships and Crushes — 2025-09-06

Hey, fellow teens! Let’s talk about that rollercoaster ride called relationships and crushes. 🎢💕 We all know how exciting and nerve-wracking it can be to have feelings for someone. The butterflies in your stomach, the constant daydreaming, the overanalyzing of every text or glance – yep, we’ve all been there.

But here’s the thing – it’s crucial to remember that your worth isn’t defined by someone else’s interest in you. You are amazing just as you are, with or without a crush. And hey, it’s totally okay if things don’t work out with your crush. Rejection is a part of life, and it doesn’t diminish your value in any way.

So, go ahead and crush on that special someone, enjoy the excitement, but always prioritize your own happiness and self-worth above everything else. Remember, you’re a boss babe/boss dude no matter what! Keep slaying, my friends! 💁‍♀️💪 #RelationshipRealness #CrushinIt #YouDoYou
