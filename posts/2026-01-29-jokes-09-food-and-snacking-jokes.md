What do you call cheese that isn’t yours? Nacho cheese! 🧀

I’m on a seafood diet. I see food, and I eat it! 🐟🍴

My favorite exercise is a cross between a lunge and a crunch. I call it lunch! 💪🥪

Remember, life is short. Eat the cupcakes! 🧁

Let’s keep the snack attacks and laughter coming because a day without laughter is a day wasted, just like a bag of stale pretzels. Stay cheesy, my friends! 😜✌️ #SnackTasticLaughs #PunnyFoodJokes
