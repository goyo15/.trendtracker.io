# Food and eating habits — 2025-09-08

Hey fam! Let’s spill the tea on food and eating habits 🍵. It’s all about that balance, am I right? Don’t be skipping meals ‘cause you’re too busy scrolling through TikTok - our bodies need fuel to slay the day! But also, let’s not go overboard with the junk food, okay? Treat yourself, but remember, it’s all about moderation. 

Also, can we talk about breakfast? It’s the most important meal of the day, people! Start your day right with some avo toast or a smoothie bowl. And don’t forget to hydrate - water is life, my dudes! 

Most importantly though, let’s ditch the diet culture. No need to stress about counting calories or restricting yourself. Eat what makes you feel good, and listen to your bod. Food is meant to nourish us and bring us joy, so let’s enjoy it without all the drama. Stay fierce, stay healthy, and snack on, my friends! 💁🏽‍♀️🥑🍇 #FoodieVibes #EatWellBeWell
