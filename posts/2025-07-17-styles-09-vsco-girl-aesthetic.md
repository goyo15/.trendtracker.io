# VSCO girl aesthetic ‚Äî 2025-07-17

Hey there, fellow teens! Let's talk about the VSCO girl aesthetic that's taken over our feeds faster than you can say "hydro flask." From scrunchies and oversized t-shirts to shell necklaces and Birkenstocks, the VSCO girl look is all about that carefree, beachy vibe that screams summer all year round. Not to mention the iconic use of the VSCO app for those perfectly filtered pics!

But let's be real, being a VSCO girl is more than just a fashion statement. It's about living that eco-friendly, save-the-turtles lifestyle. Sksksk and I oop might be our new favorite catchphrases, but they also remind us to be mindful of our impact on the environment. So grab your reusable straw and metal water bottle, and let's save the turtles together!

Whether you're fully embracing the VSCO girl vibes or just dipping your toes in, remember the most important part is being true to yourself. Stay stylish, stay eco-conscious, and above all, stay true to the VSCO girl within you.‚úåÔ∏èüê¢ #SaveTheTurtles #VSCOgirlAesthetic
