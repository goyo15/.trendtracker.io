# VSCO girl aesthetic — 2025-10-24

Hey, fellow teens! Let’s talk VSCO girl aesthetic — the ultimate vibe for summer 2021. Picture this: oversized tie-dye shirts, hydro flasks covered in stickers, scrunchies galore, and Birkenstock sandals. The key to nailing the VSCO girl look is effortless, beachy vibes mixed with eco-conscious choices. Save the turtles, am I right?

But let’s not forget the essential accessories: shell necklaces, metal straws, and of course, that iconic friendship bracelet stack. And don’t even get me started on the obsession with all things coconut-scented.

So, grab your camera and head to the nearest beach for that perfectly curated sunset pic. Embracing the VSCO girl aesthetic is all about embracing nature, good vibes, and living your best summer life. Stay salty, stay stylish! #VSCOgirlvibes ✌🏼🌊🌞
