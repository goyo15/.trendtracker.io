# School or neighborhood gossip — 2026-01-29

Hey, squad! Let’s spill some tea on the latest school or neighborhood gossip swirling around like a tornado. From whispering in the halls to shady DMs, gossip spreads faster than you can say “OMG!”

Whether it’s who’s crushing on who or the scandalous drama that went down at the party last weekend, gossip is like a wildfire – it spreads like crazy. But hey, let’s keep it real, fam. While gossip can be entertaining AF, it can also be straight-up toxic.

Before you hop on the rumor mill train, remember that spreading rumors can seriously hurt someone’s rep and cause major drama. So, grab your iced latte, spill the tea responsibly, and maybe throw in a compliment instead of shade. Because in the end, it’s all about lifting each other up, not tearing each other down. Stay juicy, babes!
